Even tiny stuff like Mr. Otterton's graying hairs, the various canines' nosepads, or even stuff like when Nick was playing around with Bellwether's hair, the movie is just bleeding with fine-combed detail. Not easy when you have just about every single kind of mammal represented.\n\nEven then the locale and huge range of scale within the city of Zootopia is amazing, especially since the vast majority of the film is done on Judy's and Nick's level so people like elephants or Bogo all the way down to hamsters gives the feel of such an impressive scope to everything around them. Even cooler to see how Zootopia accommodates everyone due to that fact.\n\nAs everyone else has already said, the characters feel real in their personality, the story is a little cliche but well executed, and overall it's a solid film. I'm not sure how plausible a Zootopia 2 could be but I could easily see a lot of shorts coming out in the future even if they didn't focus on Judy/Nick just to explore the world even more."

Kudos to all involved. So, so much better than the trailers. So cute!\n\n2) Judy Hopps is one of the most feminine characters I've seen on screen recently. The chest head-butt crying scene. That's a thing! Girls do that! \n\n3) I love what they did with Gideon, the bully fox from the beginning. I know so many people who turned out like that. \n\n4) This movie is smart. It takes its chosen issues head on, but in a way that lets everyone feel like it's talking about them. As someone else said, it's not about the racism or sexism of a specific time and place, it's about the ideas as a whole, and shows how everyone experiences prejudice in one way or another.\n\n5) What a fantastic piece of propaganda. There is a moral message you are intending to push with this film, and even seeing it happening, it didn't bother me. I even liked it. \n"

(for reference this is from the prospective of a 17 year old guy and his friends)\n\nThis movie is fucking fantastic. We were planning on going to see London has fallen. As a joke I said instead why don't we see Zootopia as a joke because I REALLY don't care about London has Fallen. Somehow I got everyone to agree and so we went in knowing literally nothing, other than there was a sloth in the movie at some point. We were all shocked immediately by the darker/depressing themes of giving up and settling and of course found them hilarious. \n\nIt turned out to be a very serious movie covered up in incredibly beautiful animation and cute animals. Also I can't stress this enough the voice acting and the animation are goddamn incredible. Personally I believe this is most well-animated movie I have seen...ever. The themes of racism, sexism, and corruption are not too heavy handed that they become annoying however they are there for anyone who may have been forced to take their kids to what was assumed to be a rather childish movie, but disney managed to make this a movie enjoyable for kids both young and old as well as adults. If you haven't even considered seeing this movie and are for some reason reading this post. GO SEE IT. I thought Finding Dory was going to be my favorite cartoon of 2016 but damn it's going to have a seriously tough time beating Zootopia. \n"

It's on the high end of what you would expect from a Disney movie.\n\nBut what really, *really* made the movie for me was the surgeon-like precision and delicacy with which it imparts general lessons about prejudice and acceptance. A lot of people have been saying the movie has allegories for racism, sexism, and the like, but I think it actually does *better* than that. You can take *any* sociological lesson away from this movie that you come into it with, and that's the real beauty of it."

Judy thinks highly of Nick, believes he'd be a great cop and shouldn't let the fact that he's a fox define him, and considers him to be her friend. Almost immediately thereafter Judy speaks to the public and expresses her belief that all predators are savages and predetermined to behave in a dangerous way based on their DNA. She even admits that she finds Nick to be dangerous based on his genetics. How do these two schools of thought interact with each other? Is my friend of a different ethnicity really my friend? What if he believes I am inferior/dangerous/stupid/untrustworthy due to my ethnicity? Is he still my friend? The movie takes a position and says \"No.\"\n\nConsider this: a person is accused of being racist for their treatment of blacks. The accused responds truthfully that there's no way she is racist because her best friend is black! Couldn't Judy have made a similar argument if she was accused of being racist? And would her argument have been persuasive? I don't think so, especially before the apology scene, because despite being friends with Nick, she holds a belief that he is inferior due to his genetics. So you, you might have good friends that are of a different ethnicity, but does that preclude you from being racist? I don't think so. "

            "body": "Zootopia is a funny, beautiful, and entertaining commentary on race relations, prejudice, and stereotypes all wrapped up in a Bunny *ahem!* Buddy Cop movie. \n\nWhen I heard that it had commentary on race relations, I will admit that I rolled my eyes thinking that it was gonna be heavy handed and corny. I'm glad that I was wrong. The citizens of Zootopia being divided by Prey and Predator was a simple and clever way to introduce the idea to kids, but not make it so ham fisted that adults would be bothered by it. \n\nThe plot is pretty cliche. Judy Hopps, a small town bunny, aspires to make a difference in the world by defying the odds and becoming the first rabbit to graduate the Police Academy, and solve cases. The cliche in this case, isn't a detriment to the overall story of Judy Hopps and her reluctant ally, Nick Wilde. It's predictable, but still very entertaining.\n\nAs for the stereotypes, there all animal related and the characters are constantly throwing them at each other at the beginning of the movie. Such as Wolves howling, Foxes are sneaky, and Rabbits are cute, fluffy, and multiply like, uh, rabbits.  There's even a scene when Judy first enters the Police Station shortly after graduation where she has to explain that the  word, \"Cute,\" is a slightly offensive term for bunnies. A lot of the animal stereotypes are played for a gag, such as the sloths working in the DMV, but they don't take away from the overall message.\n\nFor parents with younger or more sensitive kiddos, there is a jump scare in the movie when Hopps and Wilde enter an abandoned hospital. I saw it coming a mile away, but I was sucked into the world of Zootopia that it caught me off guard as well as everyone else in the theater.\n\nSpeaking of the world, Zootopia is absolutely beautiful. Every scene is gorgeously animated and brought to life. I couldn't help but be immersed in the world from the colorful Downtown, to the dark and wet Rainforest, to the cold and snowy Tundra Town.\n\n\nThis isn't a musical, so parents won't have to worry about listening to  a song about how Predators are not bad animals for the next six months. There is a song by Shakira, who also plays a protester and a Pop Star Gazelle that is kinda catchy, but that's not until the end of the flick.\n\nI can't wait to watch it again, and I highly recommend people do the same.\n\n# TL;DR: I loved it!!"

And jokes for everybody. \n\n\nJudy was a fantastic lead character and one that anyone can easily stand behind.  The sloth scene almost killed me, and I am happy it wasn\u2019t spoiled to me with that sloth trailer I later found out about. It was a good joke to throw in Alan Tudyk again as a character idd Duke from Weaseltown. Breaking Bad references! \n\n\nNow, a lot of it felt predictable. The lamb being the villain was pretty obvious early on. Awkward Giselle/Shakira song forcing. \n\n\nBut I want more Zootopia. I think I want it in a TV show, that way they can get me a lot of sweet episodes like a police procedural. I wouldn\u2019t want to wait five years just to get one story movie again.

The pacing was pretty tight; the only \"slow\" scene was the sloth scene and that ...well, yeah. That makes sense. The film was quick to keep the story moving, and the callbacks weren't super cheesy. It was like...Hot Fuzz Jr. I really, really enjoyed the dynamics of Nick and Judy. Definitely ended up wanting to see more of their antics - Bateman's perfect at playing the fox, but there's so many great back-and-forth moments between Bateman and Goodwin. I feel kind of dirty for saying that there was some fantastic chemistry but there you go. \n\n\n^God ^damn. ^All ^those ^repressed ^childhood ^feelings ^from ^Robin ^Hood ^- ^huh. ^Who ^knew.\n\nedit: it was nice that the movie didn't end up being the classic disney romance.

There's a lot of really good potential for a series that features short stories and small cases they solve.  edit 2: also, ha. the shakira parts.

If you're turned off from seeing it because you think it's a kids' movie, I really think you owe it to yourself to reconsider because this was really, crazy good.      \n  \nFirst, there are tons of jokes here aimed directly at adults, and I would argue most of them land really well. We have references to pop stars, mob movies, hit TV shows, dealing with bureaucracy, etc. that were clearly made with adults in mind. Disney picked this strategy up from other studios and it works really well here.  \n  \nSecond, there's something refreshing and captivating about the world these creatures live in. The scene where the protagonist, Judy, first arrives in Zootopia by train, drew me in. Each of the different eco-zones in the city is beautifully crafted and interesting. If the city existed (say, as a theme park), it would be a place I would want to visit.  \n  \nThird, the character development in this film is top notch. Judy Hopps and Nicholas Wilde are not perfect, cute little creatures. They have serious character flaws. They both have their own form of prejudice stemming from childhood experiences. Despite that, they're able to come together and become close friends in a way that's moving and believable.  \n  \nBut it's not just the main characters. It seems like every idd character has something interesting to offer in terms of development. Take Mayor Lionheart for example. Here we have a character who starts out as an obvious loudmouthed caricature. But by the time the movie reaches the end, we find out he has both good and bad reasons driving his actions. Why does he [do what he does?](#s \"i.e. capture the predators\") You can say that he's acting selfishly to protect himself or you can say that it was out of a genuine desire to protect the city. Look at Judy's parents. At first, they don't believe in her because they're worried about the world crushing her spirit, but slowly they come around to supporting her. Even for a kids movie, the characters are well rounded and top notch.  \n  \nSome have said the story is predictable. I can't speak for those people, but at the risk of sounding dim, I'll admit I didn't really see what was coming until the train station scene. It was a genuinely mild surprise to me with, once again, a relatable character acting for understandable reasons (i.e. being treated poorly).  \n  \nFinally, the film borrows from Aesop's playbook to bring us an important moral that is worth learning: Try everything, don't let people box you into a stereotype, and be open minded about other people and who they can be. There were obvious references that paralleled with race and issues of inclusion that I thought were really well done.  \n  \nOverall, this movie at least a 9 out of 10 for me. I know you think it's a kids' movie, but please--don't just make a snap judgment. Be open minded and give it a try.  \n  \nA+"

There were some parts where I went \"wow that was really clever\". \n\nI went in expecting a solid 6-7/10, campy, catering to young kids, wanting to sell toys and spinoffs. What I got was a solid 9/10, with great story telling, amazing characters, tremendous writing and acting, and more subtlety than expected. \n\nThe only part I really can complain about is that awful shakira song. So hamfisted and forced, and really doesn't fit the mood at all. But that wasn't *that* bad. I just hated it. \n\nSeriously though, if you're on the fence about seeing it, do it! It's seriously good. Honestly I was blown away by it. It's not just your average campy disney movie trying to sell toys, and create a myriad of spin-offs and cash-ins. It's actually a good standalone movie, with a fantastic story and all the stuff I already said. \n\nTL;DR; Went in expecting cynical 6/10, got a fantastic and heartfelt 9/10. Also fuck that shakira song. "

I'm actually having trouble thinking of a Disney movie that *doesn't* have any moral to it at all.\n\nJust a few examples: \"Don't take life/time/friends for granted\" (Up, Toy Story, Lion King). \"Kids need space, but also appreciate and respect your parents\" (Finding Nemo, Brave). \"Be open to new experiences and new ways of doing things\" (Toy Story, Brave, Monsters Inc, and I know it's not Disney, but HTTYD). And even \"don't prejudge/underestimate people\" (Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas, Ratatouille, Wreck-it-Ralph, Lilo and Stitch, and again not Disney, but Shrek).\n\nVirtually no one calls these movies \"propaganda\" even though plenty of them have clear messages they're trying to convey to the audience, including kids. Not even the movies about prejudice and preconceptions normally get called propaganda. Granted, a lot of the movies with a message about prejudice, usually focus the message on a discriminated individual rather than groups.\n\nZootopia just takes that same message and makes it clear that it also applies to more wide-reaching real life examples like race. The message in this movie isn't that new, even for Disney. What's new is that they weren't afraid to use a more controversial example of how this message can be applied, and the movie doesn't dance around that fact at all.\n\nMaybe you didn't like the way the message was handled or portrayed in this movie, or maybe you didn't like the message at all, but the simple fact that it has a message and doesn't cushion it's real-life implications doesn't make this any more propagandic than dozens of other kids movies.

They spent all this time establishing that she'd have difficulties as a bunny, and instead of playing to her strengths as a bunny she kind of just blunders onto some clues and lucks out with others. Other than the pen recording and some quick math and plant knowledge, she doesn't actually do anything. Nick did most of the work and thinking. It's mostly just a pet peeve of mine, when children's movies mistake tenacity and lots of luck for hard work. I would have preferred if she hadn't just given up, run away from the mess she started and gone home only to luck out on hearing a colloquialism, but instead had kept working on solving the case. But that's just my personal opinion. \n\nAlso did Disney sneak a gay couple in there? The Oryx neighbours have a hyphenated last id and live in an implied one bedroom. I mean they could easily be brothers too, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was ambiguous on purpose. "

Their quick wit and humor make them enjoyable to listen to.  The dialogue is not overly exposition heavy (which can happen a lot in animation movies for younger audiences).  Even though there were some pretty obvious themes being expressed in this (racism, speciesism\u2026?), it never felt like the dialogue explaining those themes was too blatant.  The things the characters were saying seemed like stuff that would have really been said.\n\nThe visual comedy in this movie is excellent, especially in that opening sequence when Hopps arrives in Zootopia for the first time.  Every species of animal had their own little pigeonholed quirk that made it really enjoyable to dart your eyes around the screen.  My favorites were the giraffe gags, like when one is coming up the escalator and you see its neck go all the way and out of frame until you see the body, or the giraffe ice cream stand, and the giraffe car that Hopps had to ticket.  Another one that I loved was the lemings all following each other to buy \u201cpawpsicles\u201d haha.\n\nThere was also a lot of great humor for adults to pick up on as well.  My favorite was the Frozen reference that the police chief made.  Another good one was the police wolf at the end that was sent undercover in sheep\u2019s skin, hue hue.\n\nThere are only two little issues that I have with Zootopia.  The first one is that after the first half, the visual gags became less and less, and those were my favorite elements of this movie.  The second is the way to story was revealed to us.  This movie is essentially a whodunit/whydunit mystery, and along the way Hopps and Nick find new pieces of evidence.  The problem is that the audience never has a chance to figure it out for themselves.  Every time the main characters discover something, it is immediately explained to us, and the audience was never given a previous example to base that guess on.  There aren\u2019t any callbacks (or none that I could tell) to previous events in the movie that make the clues really CLICK.  It\u2019s more of \u201cOh this new thing is related to this new thing.\u201d  The audience doesn\u2019t get to piece it together, it\u2019s pieced together for them.\n\nOr maybe on a second viewing I\u2019d see EVERYTHING I missed haha.\n\nBut hey, it\u2019s an animated Disney film targeted for youngins.  And I loved it.\n\n8/10.  Excited for the inevitable sequel that will not be as good but hopefully still entertaining.\n"

It was so exciting to see how roles were filled by animals and how different species interacted with each other. I would love to have a discussion of some of the grievances I had about it though. Massive spoilers below.\n\nA criticism I have for the movie, however, has to do with how the plot progressed. Specifically, the film didn't do a good job convincing me that she should have felt guilty about dividing Zootopia. Clearly, what was dividing predators and prey was that animals were going savage; she was not the cause, she just discovered it. I can't really get behind a character that identifies this enormous problem, somehow concludes that she is at fault without further investigation and then quits.\n\nI also thought it was cheap how Judy discovered the source of how animals were going savage. She had exactly one scene where she was back home and by chance, she discovers the nighthowlers, whose effects are immediately explained by her mom. Not much suspense there. When plots are designed like that, they leave no satisfaction for viewers who are trying to solve the mystery on their own.\n\nAnother criticism I have was the conflict between Judy and Nick. Nothing actually develops in their relationship between the time that they \"break up\" and get back together. Judy's guilt over what she said is instantaneous and Nick is just a snarky comment away from unquestionable forgiveness. They didn't actually overcome any conflict with each other before becoming 100% chemistry buddy cops.\n\nWith that said, there's no doubt that the world crafted in Zootopia fills you with wonder. There's so much potential for new species, crime stories and foreign cities that I can't wait to discover in a sequel. I just hope they can make their stories a little more nuanced. "

Tried four different spoiler tags and none worked, even the one suggested in the sidebar, so oh well, here goes)\n\nI expected to like Zootopia, and I ended up liking it even more than I thought I would because of the way they handled some very important issues in a polished manner.  The subjects of racism, prejudice, gender discrimination, and racial profiling are especially pertinent in our current socio-political climate.  Many plot elements of the movie can be interpreted as analogies to Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric, Clinton's \"Apex Predator\" speech, Islamophobia, Black Lives Matter, and Eugenics.  Production began in 2013, it was written and conceived even earlier, before many of the events that we associate it with today. \n\nIt has a timeless theme, prejudice (or bias as Byron Howard states in this article http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-disney-fixed-a-huge-mistake-with-zootopia-just-one-1753845684), and it presents it in a remarkable way.  There is no ham fisted, one dimensional character who is a parody of a bad cop or any particular politician, it's all revealed through the flaws and mistakes of the two protagonists Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde.  We learn of their background, their childhood experiences, their ambitions and setbacks and how that led to the internal struggles they must overcome to become ethical adults.  \n\nWe see Judy Hopps struggle with her own bias as she befriends and collaborates with Nick Wilde.  She seems to not recognize this as an issue for herself, ignoring her parents' fears of the city and the foxes therein.  She even tries to overcompensate for her species' general dislike of foxes, standing up for Nick Wilde when he faces discrimination and then buying the Jumbo Pop once he claims to have lost his money.  Only later when she presents her theory on the biological basis behind predatory species reverting to violence, and subsequently hurting Wilde, does she realize the extent of her own bias beliefs.\n\nBy presenting this story with animal characters, the audience is forced to confront their own beliefs.  Nothing about rabbits being fearful of foxes seemed offensive or shocking, it's even humorous as they use prop gags with a fox repelling line of pepper spray and tasers.  Hopps' parents seem all the more lovable and quaint because of their fears of the city and warnings about predators.  Yet this is not untamed nature, this is Zootopia, a place founded upon a civil contract that animals of all types can coexist.  To hold such bias tears at the fabric of their society, particularly when it is used by figures of authority to create a climate of fear and oppress minorities.  The use of a muzzle as a means of control, stifling their speech is an effective metaphor that appears natural in an anthropomorphic setting.  Perhaps the most complex use of animal as metaphor comes in the form of Assistant Mayor Bellweather.  The antagonist being a sheep who seems docile and likeable, yet is eventually revealed to be a perpetrator in a conspiracy to instigate violence and seize further control through fear.  It begs the question, is her course of action the result of self-determination, or is she trapped in a paranoid belief system that justifies oppression by manifesting the very thing she fears? \n\nThese themes are not anything I could have anticipated.  While there have been many children\u2019s movies that have had dark elements and topical subjects, Zootopia pushed the boundaries of what they could include yes still function as a family movie.  It\u2019s a buddy movie with messages about friendship, making mistakes, and forgiveness that are equally as important.  There were multiple intense, heart wrenching scenes that made the characters all the more human, or anthropomorphic as it were.  Zootopia is truly a gem that teaches some lessons we needed to hear. \n"

The animals that went \"savage\" were never tested for eating Night Howlers, and a cure was developed after the case was resolved at the end of the film.\nThat's depressing in two ways. \n\n1) Night Howler psychosis might have been a known trauma but no medical advances were done until after the issue was sensationalized.\n\n2) The small hick town is so detached from modern society/the big city that their issues aren't even on the world's radar and visa-versa. Sure, they have newspapers, but Judy's parents didn't seem at all interested in the predator case sweeping the city. And did Judy's relative that went crazy over Night Howlers ever get the proper treatment, or is he just trapped in the loony bin?"

It covers some really mature themes for a kids film- political corruption, racism [spoilers](#s \"State-enforced racism, even!\"), fear of the police, drugs... it was kind of bizarre seeing a plot that wouldn't be out of place on CSI acted out by cartoon animals.\n\nEven Judy isn't free from prejudice, which is refreshing to see in a main character- she keeps a bottle of what is essentially pepper spray by her side through most the movie, specifically formulated to work on foxes. She almost uses it when she first meets Nick, and [spoilers](#s \"Nick takes notice of this, and calls her out on it after she gives a press conference where she says that predators have a biological urge to be... well, predators. They have a small fight, and Nick almost gets her to pull the spray on him.\") It's a heavy moment.\n\nThe movie doesn't try to hide that the world isn't perfect- it's impossible for harmony to exist at all times, and people are always going to marginalize and look down on you for what they think you can and can't do. Not everyone can be anything- there are always limiting factors in place, but we should try our damnedest to overcome them, whether it's a physical limitation or just how people look down on you.\n\nOnto the technical side of things, the voice acting in this is spectacular- I started crying when Judy [spoilers](#s \"comes crawling to Nick, begging to be forgiven after she pretty much caused Zootopia to fall out of harmony due to implying predators- and only predators- can become 'savage'.\") J.K. Simmons is on point as the mayor, Jason Bateman is hilarious as Nick, Idris Elba was friggin *awesome* as Chief Bogo, and after seeing Jenny Slate as Assistant Mayor Bellwether, I realized that she needs to be in more films. The characters look better here than they have in any Disney 3D film before.\n\nOne last thing: if you go into it, be prepared to invoke the MST3K Mantra at certain points- for instance, Nick's establishing scene includes a sequence at an ice cream parlor. It could be Gelato (which can be made with water), but now that I've gotten home, I find myself wondering where they got the milk. Ew.\n\nOn a related note, Nick and Judy are coming to Disney parks and... [AAAAAUUUUUGH!](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2016/03/nick-wilde-and-judy-hopps-are-on-the-way-to-disney-parks-direct-from-disneys-zootopia/) They look terrifying! Jeez, Disney, you clearly know who your periphery demographic's gonna be, so maybe talk with someone who makes fursuits for a living? They know what makes anthropomorphic animals aesthetically pleasing, and could probably design all sorts of cool shit for the costumes- built-in cooling systems, blinking eyes, an articulated mouth, that kind of thing."

I feel obligated to comment on this as to how it relates to a sequel. So if they're now partners, that would have to involve some cop/procedural/mystery-type plot. To fit in with the original's subtle/symbolic commentary on societal issues, the sequel's overarching mystery would likely have to include something like that as well. \n\nCombine all that with the growing relationship between the two main characters, the thing that jumped to mind was some form of kidnapping plot involving kids (maybe all predator, maybe all prey, maybe mixed) that also somehow ties in to the fact that Judy/Nick can't have them, interracial couples, adoptions/orphans, etc. Not sure if it'd be one high-priority kidnapping or systemic, but there are plenty of criminal/mystery plots that could be adapted to fit the world. Maybe one of them gets framed. Or they could just remake Chinatown.\n\nYou know what, the movie that just popped into my head is Gone Baby Gone. Something like that, where it again threatens to divide the whole city. And if they want to go off track and go full Empire Strikes Back, maybe it actually does divide it this time."

Though I guess even if she was, it's the stereotype of how women can't be \"feminine\" and do other things.\n\nAlso, I think the plight of taking the task of being a meter maid too seriously was another harsh truth. Judy should've taken it down a peg with providing tickets, but it's a tough and underappreciated job, especially since sometimes overdue parking can be a major issue, especially in crowded areas.

Animation and art style was incredible, characters were well-fleshed out and some had good on-screen chemistry, plot was decent (actually got me in the end), some surprising adult themes and jokes were tackled too. I know its a Disney movie but I think it's fun to think about the world itself (maybe it's because I study biology). Some thoughts on that:\n\nDomestication doesn't seem to occur as there's no humans (although some of the pigs and sheep looked like domestic breeds, but it's hard to be sure). I know they really only showcased 'classic' mammals (and I'm impressed at the number shown) but I was also surprised at the lack of primates. Perhaps they removed primates completely in this universe so that humans weren't an option? \n\nOther thoughts include the ecosystems in Zootopia: there's meant to be twelve and we got to see 3-4. I wonder if there's a coastal ecosystem for our marine mammal friends, and a cave ecosystem for bats? I also found it interesting that the town outside of Zootopia seem more afraid of predators (since Zootopia was created for predators and prey to live in peace). Do rural areas differ in predation? \n\nWhat do predators eat? They've got a lot of human-based foods obviously but there's a bit of talk about predation being in the 'biology,' so carnivores would have to satisfy that in some way. Maybe they make meat substitutes in Zootopia? Not impossible!\n\nFinally, how do the other major animal groups play into this (fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians, invertebrates)? We could see flies and a fish market were in the movie, so they exist, but are they 'sentient?' Do these groups have their own Utopias? What would happen if these Utopias met? How would the predation hierarchy shift?\n\nGoodness this movie was done so well and so fun to think about. Left wanting more from the world and some of the characters too. Lots of potential to explore, would be cool if they brought out an Ecyclopedia or something. \n"

Just my take.\n\nI'm also really glad that they didn't pair Nick and Judy as a romantic couple. I had some fear they were going to go for the tried trope of the two eventually falling in love, and I thought the movie was much, much better for them having not done that.\n\nThe movie also had probably some of the prettiest and most amazing imagery I've seen in any Disney movie. They truly did an incredible job setting up the backdrop and the world.\n\nAlso, I feel like a sequel is inevitable. The way they set up the ending, it seems like it just begging to be continued.\n\nBesides all those points though, I think everyone else here has touched on everything else I was thinking.

            "body": "Man, what a great movie. Like one of the reviewers said, it's so well made that you forget that it's animated and I can't agree more. I always had a slight problem with most animated movies in that they are usually so fast paced and so low on actual plot/story that they usually feel like just bigger episodes of your regular cartoons. Zootopia, on the other hand, works as a good film.\n\nI've been hyped for this movie since early 2013, when it was just announced and never have I ever thought it's gonna be this good. I loved everything about it and it pretty much sets the new bar of quality of both visuals and storytelling in animation. I really like WDAS' previous cgi movies, like BH6, Frozen, Tangled and such, but they feel like slightly awkward tries and experiments, with Zootopia being a product of all that effort, a finally realized potential.\n\nThe thing that bummed me down most after watching this movie is returning to a bleak real world. Zootopia is just a beautiful place and it's realized brilliantly. The worldbuilding is just insane, I'd love to just go through the movie frame by frame and see everything, that's how detailed it is. I wish the movie stopped more often and just allowed us to look around more. All this seriously reminded me of Avatar with its Pandora, the place that makes the real world just look boring.\n\nI adore both main characters. Judy is instantly likeable and Nick, while being an embodiment of a stereotypical \"sly fox\" is great, too. Charming rogue and an underdog are my favorite types of character because of how relatable and interesting they are. Couldn't get enough of these two. Especially Judy, she's cute and a great role model. I think she'll be everybody's favorite, but Nick is no supporting character either.\n\nThe story was pretty simple, it pretty much hits every checkbox as far as buddycop movies go. Still, it was done nicely and kept the pace going, plus I didn't expect some of the twists and turns, it was widly (heh) entertaining, especially because this type of story naturally allows for a lot of travel and this just couldn't work better for this beautiful city. The timeless message of prejudice and such were handled very well and the perspective of animals on all of this is fresh and fascinating. It was pretty heartbreaking at times, too.\n\nVisuals were just so, so good. I thought The Good Dinosaur and Big Hero 6 looked splendid, but neither had creativity or visual splendor and variety of Zootopia. The scene with Judy arriving on a train is just breathtaking. The music by Michael Giacchino wasn't especially noticeable, but it worked as a score well enough, I should give it a listen outside of the movie. Try Everything by Shakira is great and works awesome as an intro and ending.\n\nAnyway, now I want to see more adventures of Nick and Judy in this city and I hope this movie will be successful enough to make a sequel happen. Disney's been on the roll since Tangled and I think their movies now are better than ever and Zootopia sits on top of this food chain :) Now I just hope that Moana will be at least half as good. The only thing I didn't like as much is Russian dub. It worked well for the most part, but sometimes the emotions of voices didn't match well to the facial expressions and some text, like billboards and such, was translated but not all of it and can appear translated in one scene and in English in another. I probably need to watch it few more times to formulate a proper opinion, but I can't really say anything bad about it. It's everything I expected it to be and more.\n\nTL;DR Loved it a lot, will watch it again.\n\ncome visit /r/zootopia"

Two things stood out - I was very impressed that Disney was able to address the racial divide (and bigotry in general) in such a natural way, so that everyone could understand it. There's plenty of grown adults out there who don't understand privilege and opression, so anything that can break it down for kids is great in my book. Second, it seemed to be made in the spirit of the Disney Afternoon cartoons - DuckTales, TaleSpin, Rescue Rangers, etc. Disney hasn't gone to that well in a while, so it was gratifying. Honestly, not even halfway through the movie I was praying for a Zootopia TV series that would follow Judy and Nick on the beat."

In the case of Judy Hopps, who also faces difficulty being taken seriously as a police officer, animators used small scale to dramatize her struggle, as she struggled to hop up on a chair in the police department.\n> \n> \"We go more species-ist rather than gender-based,\" said Howard. \"The fact that Judy is actually struggling against this is pretty relatable for a lot of people."

I loved how this movie took its time at the beginning to develop Judy. Most films would just blast through scene to scene to get to the action. The writing here was impeccable, the animation incredible, and the world building was breathtaking. The amount of thought put into what would normally be considered throwaway details, such as handing a giraffe a drink at a shop, was amazing. I know I would need to watch it again because there's so many little details like parody billboards and businesses in the background. I can't even think of enough positive adjectives to describe this film -- it's pretty much as close to the high end Pixar tier that Disney has ever come. \n\nThe premise of a Bunny Cop surviving in the big city alone was interesting enough to drive the story, and then they kept adding layers to it. I also appreciated how there wasn't a major protagonist throughout most of the film, it was society and prejudice that was our villain. I felt that this is by far the funniest Disney film of recent memory. I appreciate that it respects that children can handle such a complex and maybe even scary story. It didn't need fart jokes to keep the audience's attention and they knew it. \n\nOne thing I felt was a little weak was the main song. It just felt on the level of typical pop to me. It's a forgettable track for a company known for releasing animated films with memorable songs."

There were a few plot holes I suppose, and I kinda wanted to see what would happen when a nonpredator got shot with the nighthowler, like seeing Hopps try to maul Nick would have been a great turn. Regardless, this was a very good film and I was not disappointed at all."

It doesn't treat the audience, children or adults, like they are stupid however and it does a great job of appealing to more than just children so I see no reason to criticize the fact that the parallels were easy to draw.\n\nMy only real complaints of the film were the soundtrack which was good but nothing all that memorable, and that I think *spoilers* the discovery of the reason why predators were going savage was a bit too convenient. \n\nNeither of those issues stop it from being a great film. I think it was quite a bit better than both Frozen and Big Hero 6, I do hope for a sequel just because I love the world of it. "

Nick's background story got to me a little bit, and I nearly teared up. I'll probably be in the minority on this, but I actually liked Bellwether a lot. \n\nAnd as someone that didn't really care too much for the Flash character before seeing the movie, I gotta admit that his scenes cracked me up. I admit that I thought he'd be annoying to due to how \"hyped\"(?) the commercials has him out to be, if that made sense. \n\nI totally want to see a sequel for this, be it a movie or a TV show.

Throughout the movie the only couples you ever see together are of the same species, whether it be the shrew(or vole?) who is getting married, Judy's parents, or the ottertons. This builds up the concept that the species only form romantic relationships with those of the same species. So they will probably have the inter-species relationship be as controversial or even more controversial to the citizens of zootopia than gay couples/ inter-racial couples were to many Americans in the 50's and 60's.

Repost from /r/fantheories follows... \n\nThe film starts out introducing us to the world of \"Zootopia,\" a land in which animals have evolved to the point that they form a society that functions in much the same way as our own. We learn that both predators and prey live together in relative harmony. We are then introduced Judy Hopps, a bunny that becomes a police officer, and her first day on the job leads her on a missing persons (otters?) case, where we learn that certain species of predators are going feral and attacking other animals. When news of this breaks, it leads to mistrust between predators (The minority, who make up 10% of the overall population) and prey (The majority, who make up 90%). Later we find out that the reason the predators have been going crazy is because the deputy-turned-actual mayor of Zootopia has been involved in a plot to manufacture a drug that causes animals to revert to their primal state in an attempt destroy the predator community.\n\nI think that's eerily similar to the commonly circulated conspiracy theory regarding the invention of crack-cocaine. A lot of people believe that crack was manufactured by the US government and distributed to poor urban areas in an attempt to tear apart the black community. The parallels are so clear it almost seems like that was the literally the filmmakers intent."

            "body": "I enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\nI went into it with a bit of apprehension because I had heard synopsis online that said it was thematically a film about prejudice and inequality. I went into the theater pretty much expecting it to just be another \"white guilt\" movie where the evil white-analog oppressor group is shown the error of their ways by the plucky minority-analog protagonist and learns to treat everyone as equals, but it surprisingly did a pretty good job of showing that *everyone* can be prejudiced and *everyone* needs to stop stereotyping others based on external characteristics. From the start, I was basically playing \"spot the white representative\", but by the end of the movie my idea of who the \"bad guys\" we're had flipped about a half dozen times.\n\nAt first it seemed like the bunnies were supposed to be the discriminated group with the main character being told it's impossible for rabbits to be police officers, but then Judy meets Nick and it seems like it's foxes who are actually the discriminated group, and then it seems like the prey species are the ones being discriminated against by the predator species, but then it's revealed that the predators only make up 10% of the population and the prey species discriminate against *them*...and so on.\n\nI went into it expecting to be guilt-tripped, but instead it was just a good mystery movie with a subplot about everyone being kinda shitty to everyone and maybe people should try not to be.\n\nThe animation was also fantastic. About the only thing that was kind of a let-down was the soundtrack. Aside from the end credits song which I was humming on my drive home (which I've already forgotten an hour and a half later), I can't really say there was *any* stand-out music. In fact, there was barely any music at all. There was the end credits and I recall a song playing while Judy was on her first trip to the city, but aside from that I don't think there was anything. Kinda weird since Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph each had a bunch of memorable songs for me."

            "body": "My review taken from my [blog](https://themoviecafe.wordpress.com/2016/03/04/zootopia-review/):\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios is giving Pixar a run for it\u2019s money.\n\n\nI didn\u2019t know much about Zootopia when I went to go see it. I knew the general setting, a world populated by intelligent animals. I knew the film was produced by the same animation studio that brought us Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and Big Hero 6, and I knew Jason Bateman played a fox in the film. That was about it. What I didn\u2019t know was that this film\u2019s primary focus was topically covering race relations in a family friendly setting, delivered through a noir-lite buddy cop story. The movie had a lot of ground to cover, and it pulls it off exceptionally. I loved this movie.\n\nI already went in with pretty high hopes. I loved Wreck-It Ralph and really enjoyed Big Hero 6,  so I was expecting a lot from this studio\u2019s next venture. That being said, Zootopia still greatly exceeded my expectations and is now my favorite film Walt Disney Animation Studios has produced in recent years. The film is just so smart and witty and mature, at times I forgot I was watching a movie meant for kids.\n\nZootopia tells the story of Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a rabbit who movies to the metropolis of Zootopia, a city seperated into various biome districts where predators and prey live together in harmony, in hopes of becoming a cop. Eventually she gets wrapped up in a kidnapping mystery, and has to employ the help of the sly fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). The relationship between these two characters is the classic odd couple, the bickering buddy cop team. This dynamic is played fairly straight throughout the film but helps give legitimacy to its noir influenced story. The chemistry between Judy and Nick is great and doesn\u2019t feel forced at all, and I really bought into their friendship/partnership.\n\nIn the opening act of the movie, Zootopia already begins tackling issues of casual racism, personifying this struggle through the distrust between various species of animals, citing their nature, etc. It\u2019s effective due to the the ridiculous and humorous approach that the filmmakers took with this theme. By showcasing racism through different species of animals, it really shined a light on how absurd the concept really is. One joke I thought was pretty clever deals with Judy getting hired to be a cop through affirmative action. Its jokes like this one that really help deliver on the overall message of the film, promoting open mindedness and acceptance.\n\nThe fact the film is able to deal in themes such as this within the constructs of an animated family comedy just shows the strength of the writing team. The writing of this film is extremely sharp and witty, the film is hilarious and I was constantly laughing throughout. The plot is well thought out, if a little predictable. The film unfortunately falls back on a similar trope for it\u2019s villain as Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph did. But other than the over familiarity in the plot, all of the characters are well rounded and the two leads in Judy and Nick both have tremendous character development throughout the film. All of the characters have notable flaws, but that just helps make them feel more believable and endearing.\n\nThe humor in the film takes full advantage of its setting. Their is a lot of great subtle visual humor in the film, just showing the various animals living day to day life in Zootopia. There are a variety of interlaced pop culture jokes, referencing things such as The Godfather, Breaking Bad, and Frozen. The film utilizes and plays off these references well, and really add to the film instead of taking away from it, which could have easily happened.\n\nThe animation in this film is extremely well done. All of the animals move realistically and are able to emote very well, which just makes the film all the more immersive. The city of Zootopia is just plain eye candy. Every thing in the city is designed with a purpose and I just wanted to spend more time in the city, exploring all the different districts. I loved the general look of the film and the animation quality was top notch.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the hell out of Zootopia, a lot more than I was expecting to. What I expected to be a cute animated comedy ending up being a topical commentary on race relations while delivering a good message to adults and kids, told through a anthropomorphised animal noir story. The film is smart, funny, and heartfelt. I loved Zootopia ."

            "body": "I'm probably gonna catch flak for this opinion but: Zootopia was decent and didn't live up to the hype. It was a thriller that could have and should have been done better by a company that in part owns Pixar.\n\nNow I know it's a Disney movie and is geared towards kids, but what I didn't think was accomplished was how they turned all those things into a larger package. The world was fleshed out and made sense yet **some** of the characters that inhabited that world felt arbitrarily placed and only served a single purpose in the entire film. I liked the themes of racism and fear of others was done well and accomplished it's goal and I liked how they tackled the entire concept in a clever way. \n\nBut at the end of the day, Zootopia is a suspense thriller that felt like I ordered a cherry coke and was instead handed diet. Someone substituted thriller-lite for my chicken parm. The film has a problem that is also a mystery, an unlikely hero to solve that problem, a road block  to solve the problem, a conclusion that doesn't solve the mystery and the eventual conclusion to the entire thing. But with every conclusion the film arrived at left me feeling like the filmmakers took the easy way out and never really nailed down the true feeling of a good thriller movie like Seven, Memento or Identity.\n\nI really wanted to see more action-reaction to everything that occurred in the film and see more character development that led me to connect better the others characters in the film. Outside of the main characters, who I only ever connected with because of the short glimpse into Judy and Nick's past, I didn't quite feel like the rest of the cast meant anything.\n\n[Story Spoilers](#s \"Concerning the story: I felt like everything up to entering the facility where the rapid animals were being held was successful. Characters were introduced and used to reach a goal that made sense. Even entering facility was done in a clever and meaningful way and helped the viewer connect to both Judy and Nick that brought them closer together. The two had already avoided death once and came out on top, Judy getting the pair into the facility only made that connection stronger. But this is where the movie hopped on the \"taking the easy way out\" train. I think once they got trapped inside the facility the film maker should have heralded back to the boxing and ticket placement sequences from earlier and had Judy face off against one of the timber wolves. She knows how to fight a target bigger than her and she has crazy good hearing, so why didn't we ever see that used again? It felt like the two sequences from earlier were just thrown in there and never gotten back to again. I wanted to see Nick hurt or incapacitated in some way and Judy had to step up and defend him like the cop she is. I wanted to see her be a real hero instead of just handing her the win every time.\")\n\n[Continuation of Spoilers](#s \"The press conference was a nice action-reaction, but I felt like instead of the short montage of predator hate that we got, we should instead have gotten something more akin to The Dark Knight Rises sequences in which the city is then gripped by fear. Citizens would close their shops and force predators out (like the ice cream guy does in the beginning of the movie) and deny them service. I felt like we should have seen a transition from a peaceful and happy city where animals co-existed to a city gripped by fear and paranoia.\")\n\n[Even more spoilers](#s \"Solving the real mystery also felt like a cop out. Judy wasn't on that farm, selling carrots for no more than five minutes before she is handed the answer by her old nemesis for free. The fuck? Really? You're not even going to make them work for it? That's just lazy story-telling. I would rather have seen something akin to the way Hot Fuzz did things and had the main character go through a serious transition where they left in disgrace while feeling terrible. Judy could have ended up at back at home, selling carrots and being around her parents while never really felling truly accomplished only to eventually end up meeting that fox baker again by chance. They could have had words and that same conversation could have taken place, but only after Judy went through a lot of emotional shit. Then once Judy figures it all out she zooms off to save the day and returns to find Zootopia in chaos where she eventually, after asking around, finally finds that Fennec con-artist whose id we never find out and he, without asking anything in return, informs her of Nick's location. Really? That con artist isn't going to ask for anything in return? He isn't even going to degrade her for being some let down of a cop who walked out in disgrace after throwing the city into a panic. Like come on. Give me a reason to connect with this guy other than a shitty elephant costume.\")\n\n[HE'S A SPOILER JIM!](#s \"I think everything including the train sequence and beyond to the end was done well and finished out the story nicely. What I would have loved to see though was a thread through the entire film as to who the actual villain really was. You saw that sheep only a handful of times through the entire film, yet there was never any real inclination that she could have been the bad guy. The filmmakers didn't even throw in one of those cheesy shadow-silhouette bad guy scenes to really highlight this person working from the shadows to set everything up. I think the villain reveal at the end would have been much stronger if you were only getting subtle clues through the entire film as to who the real perp was. She's also a pretty weak villain because how the fuck does she know all these things anyway?\")\n\n[IT'S THE SOUND OF SPOILERS](#s \"How does this sheep really know about these flowers anyway? I can understand why Judy knows about them - she's from a family of farmers and the study of plant life was even highlighted in some of her dialog. But the sheep? Fuck if I know. Was she some random sheep who found out about this flower by reading a magazine? Was she told by someone? Did she have past experience? Was she a farmer from a small town as well? Was she the failed Judy Hopps? Did she come to Zootopia from a farming family in another burrow with the same dreams and aspirations as Judy but they were never fully realized and she ended up being an assistant for that Lion mayor? Did she have pent up rage from all this failure and only connected with Judy because of her upbringing and her species? What if she used Judy through the entire film to achieve her own goals - like having the mayor arrested? What if the sheep was dropping hints (like the joker did for Batman in The Dark Knight) and leading Judy to her eventual goal? All of these questions go unanswered and it's a huge letdown because that villain could have been so much stronger. Hell, they could had the two duke it out at the end once Judy trumps her only for Judy to lose and eventually have the whole Wild Nick acting scene occur. On that note - who the fuck plans to get captured? Why did they pull that ammo out of that gun in the first place? How did they know they were going to get captured? Why not just take it straight to HQ and be done with it? Who the fuck carries around a bio-weapon in their pocket like it's a chocolate bar?\")\n\nOverall the entire film felt lazy and half-assed and while I understand it's a kids movie, so was Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph, it could have been done so much better. Sorry for all the spoiler tags, I know this looks like something requested from the CIA, but I didn't want to ruin anyone's viewing experience!\n\nAlso they rode Shakira hard on that marketing train. That last sequence was bleh."

I always feel that Disney films are pretty even in terms of being a kids/adult film. I agree with most on here saying the sloth scene was the funniest scene in the entire film and I probably laughed 2 or 3 times more, but that's it. \n\nIt definitely has a good message for kids. I'm sure kids will love the film and it's a good film for kids, but as an adult, I felt it was a little flat. I always think of Wreck It Ralph and Big Hero 6, where I felt those to be an even split where adults could actually enjoy it. "

            "body": "I'm in the minority here, but I didn't really like it, and I'm not sure if it's just because I'm to old for this movie.\n\nThe overarching message is \"don't treat people as stereotypes!\" when only a few characters actually do that. Guess what the only weasel's only characteristic is? He's a weasel! Foxes are sly! Bunnies are timid! I have no idea why all the people are going mad over the race part of the story. Anti-discrimination themes are in every animated movie. Dumbo, Mulan, Wreck-It Ralph, Ratatouille, Inside Out...\n\nThe character's decisions and reactions don't make any sense. The best example of this is at the press conference scene. Nick is somehow shocked and appalled at Judy saying that the craziness seems to be a biological thing that only affects predators, even though she said that using the evidence she collected WHILE HE WAS THERE. This isn't news to him, he heard it too. When explaining herself, Hopps says that \"It's not like a bunny could go savage\" in a strangely condescending tone that goes against the previous hour of character development. Then he makes a mock \"I'm a killer too!\" face and for some goddamned reason Judy actually believes he's serious, despite trusting him enough to give him a fucking application to the force. Then, he gets huffy about the fox repellent, and in true romantic comedy fashion, Judy sputters about it instead of simply saying \"my racist parents gave it to me.\"\n\nBonus points awarded to the ending conflict basically being the same as the Power Ranger Movie's, with a mind controlled good guy attacking a non-controlled good guy. I'm certain that the \"I'm faking being mind-controlled\" thing has been used in another animated movie before, but the title escapes me.\n\nAll in all, I found the movie just frustrating. It was funny, sure, but the events that move the actual plot forward are poorly done, in my opinion. Points I liked about the movie:\n\n* Animal jokes were consistently funny. \"Rabbits are good at multiplying\" being the standout.\n\n* The Mr. Big Vito Corleone scene was absolute gold\n\n* Poor ol' JK Simmons and Shakira did so much with what few lines they got to work with.\n\n* Some of the best animation I've seen in a movie.\n\n\nEDIT: Added some examples for how the theme isn't original."

I think we are in a golden age of kids movies in many ways, from DreamWorks franchises like Kung Fu Panda, Pixar films, and now these off shoot Pixar-lite Disney films. While they may not hold the weight and effectiveness of a Pixar led Disney animated feature, these other films still have a lot of the heart and laughs of a traditional Pixar film. Although this movie does suffer from a couple of slow parts, it features wonderful connections that adults can laugh at without being inappropriate for kids, and it has several references to different genres of cop movies (which I was a big fan of). This is the perfect movie for the family and while it may not be a classic, it will most likely stand out as one of the top 2 or 3 kids movies of the year.\n\nI give Zootopia a B+"

These days US got color problems, Europe has refugee/religion problems. But strongly build the story on the assumption that predator gets better and their inherent nature won't be triggered bothers me, so does the classification of predators and others.\n\nOverall, technically it's great at least 9/10; story telling, awesome; main idea trying to be conveyed, great; but I'm not a fan of how it's so constructed.\n\nI'm not quite sure what I'm talking about, it's really the first time I have so much mixed/weird feeling after watching an animation film.

So do lions and wolves, etc. So what do they eat? They never answered that question and I couldn't get past it.\n\nAlso, they do show animals eating ice cream, which means they have to be getting milk somewhere, which means cows in this universe would have to be slaves.\n\n\nAnother thing is that I didn't like the message that anybody can be anything. That is not really true. I can't play in the NBA or be an astronaut or be a theoretical physicist. That's not about prejudice or discrimination. Individuals simply do not all have the same abilities. The general message about bigotry and unconscious prejudice was good, but what's true on a macro level is not necessarily true on a  micro level. For example, recognizing that gender is not a barrier to becoming a doctor does not mean that all women are therefore capable of being doctors. \n\nThe movie even steps on its own message a couple if times by preaching against stereotypes and against making assumptions about \"biology,\" but then it has scenes of animals behaving in stereotypical, biologically programmed ways for laughs (the sloths, the wolves trying not to howl).\n\nIt sounds like I hated the movie, which I didn't, but I wish it had been tightened up a little bit on the premise."

Come on John Lasseter.... You're better than this.\n\nAnother thing... If the predators (and foxes too) keep doing things to make the \"prey\" fearful....

I love female leads in films generally, but sometimes I feel like writers try too hard to make them fit into what they think a protagonist should be and basically write a very stereotypical male character as a female. I'm glad there were so many aspects to Judy's personality. Of course there were some tropes, but all characters have them, and her's were done nicely. I think it's one reason characters like her and Nick felt so real.\n\n> 3) I love what they did with Gideon, the bully fox from the beginning. I know so many people who turned out like that.\n\nExactly! I was thinking that when I came out of the movie today. One peer of mine told me of issues he had with this one neighborhood kid he grew up with. They grew up in a medium-sized town, and he left after college to go find work. Went back home and found out the former kid is now working for his parent's business, is quite a nice fellow.\n\n"

The animals that went \"savage\" were never tested for eating Night Howlers, and a cure was developed *after* the case was resolved at the end of the film.\n\nThat's depressing in two ways.\n\n1) Night Howler psychosis might have been a known trauma but no medical advances were done until after the issue was sensationalized.\n\n2) The small hick town is so detached from modern society/the big city that their issues aren't even on the world's radar and visa-versa. Sure, they have newspapers, but Judy's parents didn't seem at all interested in the predator case sweeping the city. And did Judy's relative that went crazy over Night Howlers ever get the proper treatment, or is he just trapped in the loony bin?"

After the first half of the movie, it had really muddled and mixed all the allegories so it's pretty much impossible to point any of them to one single issue. If you can use it's message as an example of pretty much any real-life situation, can you really say that it's meaning exactly what you took out of it? This is a positive thing I think because it goes deeper into the issue of prejudice, acceptance and fear. It even teaches the kids that you can do enormous harm in the id of good or justice. ^^Or ^^how ^^the ^^baddie ^^can ^^have ^^the ^^problem ^^glasses. \n\n\nIf I would watch it a second time, I'd say that the beginning would go down better now that I know that the movie isn't going to the direction I expected it to be heading.\n\n\nOverall I'd say the film is one of the strongest Disney animated-films in years, perhaps because they got to use the knowledge they got when they were still drawing the animals for their animations. The weak point of the film for me personally was Shakira and I wish the movie would've had more original and more memorable music."

Probably not. Why did she have that subconscious reaction? Because the idea of protecting oneself from predators exhibiting aggressive behaviour has been indoctrinated into Judy's mind probably since she was a kid. Then again it is up to Judy herself to consciously reject such indoctrination, or did she not try hard enough at doing that? Should Judy or the society take the blame? It's difficult to answer, just like in real life. Every individual has their unique reasoning for their actions and it's usually a mix of various factors instead of a single one."

(Except the Sloth government workers.)  \nThey're not dealing with any specific stereotypes, they're dealing with stereotypes in general.  \nThey also make it very clear that all of these different species have transcended beyond their savage pasts, so the implication that they're worried about, that they really are inherently different, is actually nonexistent.  \n\nMostly I think that the reviewer is just overthinking it and making it more complicated than it needs to be.\n\nI also think that the reviewer is in denial about their own furry sexuality, given how bothered they are about sexualized animals.

Basically, \"better\". \n\nThings like Tiana's lesson that working for what you want is better than wishing on a star, Frozen's \"You can't marry someone you just met\" and parallels to a coming-out story, Ralph's \"there's no one I'd rather be than me\", and so on. Zootopia is a pretty much perfect continuation of this trend. \n\nI'm so glad kids will grow up with movies like these."

Instead of a lot of low-quality, poorly written, poorly cast content I would never enjoy or watch, it would be best if they just continued with movies.\n\nI would just hope it's not *5 years* to continue this really fun universe.

She was the absolute best cop for that job, because of her size and speed. And if she hadn't done that, and saved the daughter of the crime boss, Mister Big wouldn't have spared her life later on, and helped her with her first big lead! So it's a doubly important \"bunny needed on the police force\" example. Also, you could argue her rural bunny family knowledge helped her piece together the last bits of the story (even if it did take her weeks to overhear the Night Howler bit by sheer luck--you have to admit, nobody in the city was piecing that together).

This movie is essentially a whodunit/whydunit mystery, and along the way Hopps and Nick find new pieces of evidence. The problem is that the audience never has a chance to figure it out for themselves.\n\nI'll agree with this mostly, the only hint was the weasel stealing the flower bulbs, and your right nearly everything is explained immediately as it's discovered. The hand holding was a heavy. I feel like they could have shown blue stuff on the jag when they open the door, or something like that but they wanted to have the prejudice moment after the press conference. \n\n\nI'm extremely proud of the previews for not giving away much of anything.

Basically the way she framed it to the public planted a seed of mistrust.  She was basically saying predators are innately untrustworthy and dangerous and that was that framed the tone of the news coverage.

She also had just heard the Mayor saying he kept it secret for that very reason, so she made his fears come true by presenting the situation in the worst way possible.\n\nI definitely agree that there should have been more clues to the actual solution to the mystery leading up to the reveal.  And it is one of those coincidence solutions that's a bit annoying, but this is also a very common trope.\n\nThe makeup scene I was alright with.  Sometimes all it takes is some \"absence make the heart grow fonder\" and a heartfelt apology.  It didn't feel unnatural to me.  And it was a very well done scene.\n\nYou also have to consider the movie is over 2 hours already.  Adding much more to the plot would have made this a very hefty Disney movie.  "

I think half of the problem here is bad lighting/settings.\n\nI've been off the past few days, but when I go into work next week, I'm sure they'll have that figured out by then.\n\nDisney *also* makes mascot costumes with internal cooling, and some  costumes have articulated mouths and blinking eyes as well. However, those are reserved for shows, like the Dream Along With Mickey show at Disney World's Magic Kingdom, or the show with Mickey on Buena Vista street at California Adventure. Edit: This is because the characters' lines are pre-recorded, and the mouths move along with the audio.\n\nThe main problem is voice.

She spots that he's holding a pawsicle and tracks down Nick (the fox). \n\nNick is unwilling to cooperate--but then she pulls out his tax records and reveals she found out he has been committing tax evasion for years (call back to him bragging about how he made so much money earlier). \n\nNick brags about how yes, he did that, but how she can't prove anything. She reveals she has recorded the whole conversation on her Carrot Pen, which also has a recorder built in. Nick has no choice but to help. \n\nNick reveals he saw the Otter head to a certain club. They go there, revealed to be a nudists club. They interview an elephant yoga instructur / ox (was it an ox? Didn't actually recognize the species). Ox has a super good memory and remembers the otter was picked up by a white car and gives them the license plate number. \n\nThey go to DMV to run the plate since Judy isn't in the police system yet (sloth scene from trailers is here). \n\nThey track the plate to it's registered address, a limo business, but it's locked due to it being night. Nick boasts that she can't go in without a warrant. Judy chucks the pen recorder over the fence, Nick climbs over to get it. But Judy, being quicker, climbs over as well and grabs the pen; saying she doesn't need a warrant if she sees a shady character breaking into the business. Proceeds to check the car they find. . . \n\n---\n\nJust a list of events; and the execution makes it *so* much better then it sounds. "

Even if you argue the \"I love you\" scene at the end is meant to be romantic, that's a very subtle reference compared to everything else tackled in the film. And they could have easily tried to bring it in via the side characters. Even having one of the characters being infatuated by Gazelle would've sufficed and making a remark on it.\n\nThen again, I also like how the story wasn't preachy just for being preachy's sake.

Despite Judy Hopps' frustration with the lack of recognition by her superior officers, the soul crushing daily routine and public disdain, and her eventual collaboration with criminal-mind Nick Wilde, she never falls into the downward spiral of alcoholism, drug addiction, abuse of power, and loss of identity as they abandon the ideals that separate cop from criminal as Harvey Keitel's character did in Bad Lieutenant.  Dare I even mention how Zootopia pales in comparison to Thin Blue Line or Making A Murderer when it comes to artful and investigative crime documentaries?  No sir or madam, I dare say Zootopia did not have the impactful aspects of these other police dramas, nor did I expect it to BECAUSE IT'S A DISNEY MOVIE ABOUT A BUNNY COP AND A GRIFTER FOX!

When she was first leaving her apartment, she was hesitant to grab it, thinks about it, leaves, then comes back and grabs it just in case."

There will always be people who live up to your worst expectations of them. Like Nick felt he might as well give in to. But the point was to not let those people color your perception of others.\n\n>The character's decisions and reactions don't make any sense. \n\nI think this was fully intentional and brilliant, because it illustrates how often we can think ourselves above prejudice. I admit the scene with Judy explaining the evidence could have been a bit better written, but the scene just after was perfect. Judy has been the victim of prejudice, and believes she's above it, and yet she isn't. Just as none of us are completely, because our brains are wired to make snap judgements, especially under stress. I see a heck of a lot of people who are so absolutely anti-bigotry that they start thinking they're immune to it, and their actions end up being extremely bigoted. They become Bellweather. She took her personal victimization and used it as justification to become even more of a bully than her own bully. That doesn't solve anything, it just makes things worse. And I'm so glad that the movie conveyed that."

However, since the story's general message was clear and admirable, I personally loved it. It's basically a brief, simplified portrayal of the more controversial and maybe spiteful topics and because of that, I didn't dislike it for the childish features."

I think Nick does at one point say that \"stereotypes come from somewhere\" or something like that. It would make sense if they were trying to say that stereotypes are true for some people, but it's wrong to think entire groups of people are that way. For example, they showed that one of the cops was wolf, and never indicated that he had a problem with howling. However he's a background character that's only on screen for a few seconds. The counterexamples are quite subtle compared to the rest of the film."

Also,  I think another argument can be made that we are not fixed. We can change,  improve,  get better,  and that we can only learn our true limits by pushing up against them. For example it's clearly true, being a woman doesn't naturally preclude you from being a doctor nor does it automatically make you capable of being one,  but one cannot if you are either capable or incapable without trying. Also,  even someone best suited for the task must take some time to learn.  \n  \n2) Yes,  the story does poke fun based on--I guess animal stereotypes--but it also immediately flips on itself. I think the best example is Flash. The sloths being slow is clearly a joke based on stereotypes,  but then at the end we see Flash acting in the exact opposite manner. "

First,  let's recognize that Judy's character begins with a latent bias/prejudice against predators. This is established throughout the film based in some part on her interactions with Gideon and the influence of her parents (e.g. Fox repellant). We should also recognize that this prejudice is also complex and in some sense subconscious and unintended,  but  a bias nonetheless. The best example of this is when she buys a popsicle for Finnick and Nick. She thinks they're criminals, follows them in the store,  realizes she's being \"specieist?\"  and tries to overcorrect and in doing so calls Nick a good father and a fox who is \"articulate\". The basic idea is that Nike isn't like other foxes who are sly, conniving, and inarticulate. He is one of the good ones. At this point in her development,  this is actually in some sense a half-virtue. She is not outright antagonistic towards predators, and is willing to make individual exceptions and to recognize that she is wrong about individuals, but not predators in general.   \n  \nFast forward through the movie and we see a growing friendship between the two that suggests Judy clearly has no prejudice against Nick, the individual,  as a predator. However,  and this is important,  a lack of prejudice against an individual is not the same as a lack of prejudice towards a group. The fact that she has come to care about Nick as a close friend does not suddenly takeaway her general bias,  which is both an important and valid point to make.   \n  \nOne could argue that Judy's conference is based simply on what was said by the scientist in Lionheart's secret detainment center,  but that doesn't excuse Judy. She doesn't question the argument that she's bringing to the table,  idly that predators are dangerous by their nature. Despite her time with Nick,  she brings the argument up during the conference and doesn't consider the consequences of accepting the argument at face value. When she's confronted with the mistake,  she tries to avoid blame by pointing out that the argument,  which she finds acceptable, doesn't apply to Nick as an individual. In the beginning, such an argument was a sort of half-virtue--better than a vice,  but not the same as doing the truly right thing. Here,  we see the limits of the idea that most predators are like A, but there are good ones that act like B. Nick is such an overwhelming exception to the rule,  that one is left with the ethical dilemma of accepting it or scrapping it entirely. The fact that Judy has grown to be friends with Nick and that this friendship doesn't negate her general prejudice is in keeping with the story's message overall.  \n  \nNick's backstory seems flimsy to us,  but we are observers of someone else's pain so perhaps we have a tendency to underestimate it. It's one thing for a neighbor to be in pain. That's cause for sympathy. If we ourselves are in pain,  then it becomes a serious crisis. Nick's attitude and choices towards discrimination are the mirror image of Judy's. Is it the optimal way to cope with discrimination? No, but it is an emotional understandable reaction. If the game is rigged against you,  there's no point in playing your best. Also, I don't think the movie has a lenient attitude towards his life choices. Nick is potentially guilty of one crime--not paying taxes. I would argue that this was something done to move the plot. Judy needs some leverage over Nick and the suggestion in the film is that the act isn't an intentional attempt to defraud,  but rather a result of negligence. Everything else he did throughout the film was legal or within the bounds of technicality.  He has permits and a license for his business, for example. This isn't to say he was acting perfectly--far from it. But he also wasn't going beyond a level of rogueishness typical of a Disney character like Aladdin for example.  \n  \nThe next part of your critique is strange to me. On one hand,  Disney plays it safe in the content of its commentary,  yet the way it's conveyed is unnecessarily contentious. I think the message is more complex than the simple notion that prejudice is bad. It goes beyond that. It's saying that prejudice can exist despite our best intentions and that it is only when we make an affirmative effort to recognize and remedy it within ourselves that we can finally reach a point of achieving virtue. It also saying that people are more than the attributes we assign to them. That's a meaningful message that not everyone fully appreciates. They understand it intellectually,  but not at a gut level.  \n  \nAs for the means of conveying this message, I don't think it gets less controversial than this. Disney is using \"cute\" animals to convey a moral. This is literally a technique that's hundreds of years old stretching back to Aesop. Furthermore, I honestly don't think you can make a direct analogy between predators and prey with particular races in our own society. You could say predators are meant to be analogs for black people,  but then how do you explain discrimination against prey in the police force,  the use of the word cute, and the fact you're not supposed to touch a sheep's wool? These are clearly gesturing to issues that speak to a lot of black people as well. So prey and predator both share characteristics of both black and white people, yet both face discrimination. So it's not as if Disney is \"preaching\" from a point of bias.  \n  \nI think that you're entitled to consider it preachy and may be right, but considering the Aesop analogy and the fact that this is a Disney movie for kids, a moral is expected. One can disagree with the moral,  while still appreciating why it's included.  \n  \nOverall,  I think this is one of Disney's best films. It even manages to exceed many of Pixar's films with the exception of maybe Ratatouille. I think,  overtime,  it'll keep the reputation of being one of Disney's better films. "

I felt that was a tad bit strong to drop that early in a Disney movie, but that's just my two cents. I loved the message and all the little nuances throughout the film, and I didn't feel targeted at all. *Note* This isn't the overall message you were talking about, I'm just elaborating on a reason why some may have felt the the movie was a bit heavy-handed. I don't think the overall message was heavy at all either. We really needed this movie."

The predators cleverly stand in for any race you could be prejudiced towards- they're a small minority that's unjustly feared, like black Americans, but they're also descended from deadly oppressors and are having a hard time shaking that image, like white Americans.\n\nThe whole point of using animals as people is that you can examine the ideas and issues of 'racism' without the baggage of our actual 'races', because when you make it about black humans and white humans, you're talking about a specific situation. When it's rabbits and foxes you can talk about racism itself without any additional context."

I think the movie had one or two issues in its message if you really think about it, but for kids the message should be pretty clear and positive. I just like that the story was interesting on its own and the character's actions made sense and had some depth. You can draw parallels between the movie and racism in our society, that makes the movie even better, but its not something as pointed as say animal farm."

The predators were also oppressors in their own way, they were the minority but they used their size, strength and \"loudness\" to oppress the \"prey\".  \nThis is relevant to any number of issues, colonization by white oppressors, the rich oppressing the poor, etc.  \n\nThis reviewer needs to learn how to look beyond real life scenarios and deal with the bare basics of the issue, which is exactly what the animal metaphor is perfect for.  \nThe movie isn't about any one thing, it's about different classes, races, genders, etc. It's about every kind of stereotype or prejudice that you can think of, acting like it's as simple as \"minorities vs majorities\" is ridiculous.  \n\nThe one thing that the review is kind of right about is that generally there really is a difference between predators and prey, which makes the analogy a bit flawed if you think about it too much.  \nBut that problem is actually mostly solved in the movie because it turned out that the \"night howlers\" also affected prey animals, although it probably would've been better if we had actually seen a prey animal turn savage.

But that leads to the question is beastality wrong because it is a sexual relationship between members of two different species, or because one party can't give any sort of content do to a lack of mental and communication abilities? If it's the latter than that would imply that a purely romantic relationship between different species would be ok as long as there is no sexual interaction, but then you have to ask where the line between friendship and romance is if both parties are acting asexually to each other. I guess my point is this a very complicated issue that I am glad the we don't have do deal with, and I'm definitely overthink a (admittedly very well made and intelligent) kids movie."

And I loved it.\n\nYea, if it was targeted at the youngins then we wouldn't have had the sloth DMV, the Walt/ Jessie joke, or the parents talking about settling early in the movie. There were a lot of jokes that I heard the adults laughing at more than the kids. "

            "body": "I know what you're saying. The guilt wasn't caused by her discovery of the \"savage conspiracy,\" it was caused by her poorly worded-press conference. While that makes more sense, I still don't like that they used that as a device to move the plot. \n\nI felt like the writers were trying really hard to manufacture the guilt in Judy. When she was speaking with the media, all the reporters kept asking her leading questions to conclude that predators are instinctively savage. She didn't form that opinion herself; they were thoughts that the reporters (but really the writers) wanted her to think. This is how the writers tried to convince us that Judy was guilty for something that wasn't her fault at all. \n\nAlso, the seed of mistrust would have spread through Zootopia whether or not she gave the press conference (someone, perhaps the assistant mayor, would have done it sooner than later). There's no way that she was the only one to notice the link between predators and all the savage animals. However, in the scope of the movie, literally no one suggests any other possible theories on what is happening. In a believable situation, people would have a discussion of inexplicable events and consider their possible causes. Instead, the writers designed everyone in Zootopia to blindly accept her conclusion so that they could pin more guilt onto Judy, which, once again, fabricates her guilt so she has a reason to go back to the farm and discover that actual cause of the problem.\n\nOf course, this was only a small personal issue I had with an otherwise nice movie. Perhaps I'll get a better feel for the plot decisions on the next viewing."

I think Nick is being very unreasonable to be offended because Judy was not politically correct enough, even though it was just established that Judy isn't comfortable doing a press conference, and it's almost hilarious that instead of blaming the actual events that lead to the attacks, Judy blames herself for saying the wrong thing. However in the context of the story arc I get that they needed some conflict between the two lead characters.\n  \nOn the other hand, if they had been politically correct and covered up the identity of the assailants (hello Germany and Sweden), they certainly would have avoided the mass paranoia between residents, but at the same time the case would never have been solved and the attacks would have continued to happen."

This movie make me wonder what exactly a bird city would be like though. And how would the aquatic mammals like cetaceans and sirenia fit into this? There are so many things they could go for if this movie get a sequel, that's what I'm hoping.\n\n"

The facial animation was particularly impressive.  The acting they got out of those 3D models was kind of astounding.  They were some of the most human animals ever animated.\n\nBut the quality of animation is not the entirety of the film.  There's story, writing, voice acting, pacing, themes, characters, societal influence, lasting impact, etc.\n\nI think it deserves a high spot in the echelon of Disney animated films.  But best Disney animated film?  I wouldn't go that far.  \n\nAnd even if he just meant the animation was the best in a Disney film, I have such a soft spot in me for the hand drawn classics I'd have a hard time agreeing with that.

That doesn't exactly scream \"American black analog\" to me.\n\nNo particular species or group in Zootopia is meant to directly depict a real life group, and for that reason everyone is going to interpret it differently. For example, feminists could point to Judy Hopps as a sexism analog for \"breaking the glass ceiling\" and the way she was seen as being incapable of handling real police work because of her small stature, but there were already plenty of females of other species depicted on the police force. So was it more of a race thing? But there were already prey species on the force as well (heck, their boss was a wildebeest). Likewise, blacks could point to the predators being stereotyped as barely-contained monsters who could succumb to their savage instincts and attack the prey species at any time as being an analog for the way they're viewed by society, but so too could MRAs see it as a depiction of the way men as a whole are viewed by feminists. Or whites could see themselves depicted as the predators, with the prey species' inability to overlook their adversarial history being a representation of white people being stigmatized for historic injustices. The prey species are shown being looked down on and mistreated by the bullying predators, but at the same time the predators are a minority group in Zootopia and are shown being actively prejudiced against and stereotyped as savages by the prey species. So who's who? It's very hard to say.\n\nThat's the beauty of the way Zooptopia handled the issue. *Everyone* is shown being both prejudiced *and* prejudiced against because the reality is that *everyone* experiences racism and prejudice in one way or another, and for that reason *everyone* will be able to find something to relate to in the film and feel represents them. The message that diversity and equality is more complex than a simple slogan on a bumper sticker, that everyone has differences and limitations and we should recognize how that makes us alike, is a remarkably serious and mature take on the subject for a children's movie where the message is usually just \"everyone is the same and you should be blind to their differences.\""

Every word is under scrutiny (and she knew it,hence her anxiety) yet she was blabbering about things she had absolutely no idea about (she is no doctor, period) and voiced personal opinions .

When Nick confronted her she was totally blindsided and got defensive and dug the hole even deeper. I thought it was a tremendously human (ha ha) moment--maybe they could have spent more time laying the groundwork, but I thought it gelled really well.\n\nAlso, I don't think she quits the force solely out of guilt--between Clawhauser's demotion and her promotion she sees that the police department is becoming segregated, and she doesn't want to be a willing participant."

A very endearing sight, I\u2019m sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged on to a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature\u2019s wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. And that\u2019s when I first learned about evil. It is built into the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior.\u201d\n\n>The two wizards exchanged a glance. Vetinari was staring into the depths of his beer mug and they were glad that they did not know what he saw in there."

            "body": "All right so for better communication, we'll need to understand ourselves better.  \n  \nI'm not sure what you mean by an outmoded form of racism that is a relic. I could make a guess at it, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. If it's racism based on biology, I would argue two things: 1) the movie focuses on biology because it makes the most sense in the context of a film where prey and predators have evolved. It would make less sense to try and claim that prey and predators are a certain way due to culture seeing as animals do not have cultures to pull from. 2) Biological racism still exists, it still comes up, it simply isn't brought out in public for everyone to see. If you're talking about a broader sense of racism, then, no offense, I'd really like to live on whatever planet you currently live on because racism, in a broad sense, definitely isn't a relic of the past.   \n  \nI don't think Disney is virtue signaling here. Virtue signaling would be suggesting that they're only bringing out this moral to win brownie points with others. But I don't honestly think they're saying they dislike prejudice simply because it makes Disney look good (although I'm sure as a corporation, they do take this calculus into account). There's more than likely a genuine dislike for prejudice and looking virtuous as an unintended side effect. Besides, why is trying to appear virtuous necessarily a bad thing? If you read, for example, Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments, there's a great argument to be made that people strive to be virtuous so that they can be better liked by their fellow man. It's a way to reward and reinforce virtue, which seems like the right thing to do if you want people to be virtuous.  \n  \nI don't know what demographic you're speaking about, but I'm assuming you mean kids. Kids aren't going to push back against a film made my animals that has a moral to it. As I already mentioned, this tactic isn't a new or controversial one (see Aesop's fables as a prime example). It's a time honored technique for entertaining and teaching kids. So if the method is not controversial, then what is left is the content. If you don't think the moral is controversial, then there shouldn't be a problem here. I think the truth is though is that you do have a problem with the content in some way. I don't know what that issue is, but I don't see how having animals in a story with a moral is any more controversial than any other animated film that does it (e.g. Finding Nemo and the importance of not overparenting your kids).  \n  \nI gave a long discussion about why Judy didn't regress from childhood or change her character at the conference. I think there's an important distinction to be made between the belief we want to have and the ones we actually hold. I covered it in detail so I won't go back over it.  \n  \nThe movie does get laughs from animal stereotypes at times. That's totally right. But just as it does that, it also goes back and totally flips them as well. The sloth scenes are the best examples. They get a lot of laughs from Flash at the DMV being slow because he's a sloth. But they also have the last gag, which is Flash driving like a madman (mad sloth?) in a speedster. I think that's a nuanced way to handle things. Some times we act like the way people think we will, but other times we don't. Because people are similar in some ways, unique in others. That's a perfectly fine stance to take.\n\n  \n"

They just turned a blind eye to contacts who participated in the drug trade. Second, the drug in the film was non-addictive and kept completely secret, which is quite different from how cocaine operated. It's possible that the film's writers were influenced by the Dark Alliance story, but you could just as easily draw connections to MKultra or various other alleged or proven government conspiracies."

So Frozen had a great deal of emotional depth to go along wth its strong plot points while Zootopia didn't have as deep a message and was not very good at plot points. That makes Frozen greater in my eyes, although Zootopia isn't a terrible film.   "

He would usually pick one or two popular movies a year to give positive reviews so that he could maintain a little respect among the critical community (in 2013, he chose American Hustle as his favorite film of the year, which wouldn't really bat an eye). They eventually realized that he was using RT as a way of attracting attention when people would ask, \"who is the asshole who gave Toy Story 3 a negative review.\" I used to check his reviews once in a while, but stopped last year. He kind of liked Inside Out though, which I found pretty surprising."

Although I did think they were bordering Tumblr-level sensitivity with Nick getting angry at Judy for saying \"You're not like them\" when referring to the animals going savage. In the theatre I immediately caught on that this was supposed to be a \"you people\" reference, but the way they put it was just confusing. She was referring to Nick being different from a small percentage of animals who were going savage out of all the predators, and Nick connected it to the \"you people\" phrase that is openly recognized as racist. But I always thought that \"you people\" was used to reference another race as a whole? That's pretty much the only thing I'm still going crazy over understanding in this movie lol.\n\nIf someone understood this part and made a connection I missed, please reply! I really liked this movie :)"

The only topic I think is less kid-friendly is that of drugs (which was pretty subtle imo, and not really something a child would pick up on).  "

(Although I'll certainly grant that there are a handful of radical fringe types who probably do believe that.) It's that *enough* men are rapists and abusers that it's entirely reasonable for women to adjust their behavior to account for the possibility that any given male might be one. (I suggest reading [this classic post](http://kateharding.net/2009/10/08/guest-blogger-starling-schrodinger%E2%80%99s-rapist-or-a-guy%E2%80%99s-guide-to-approaching-strange-women-without-being-maced/) and [this follow-up](https://researchtobedone.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/for-those-who-dont-understand-schrodingers-rapist/) for further explanation.)\n\nContrast that with what happened in *Zootopia*, where you only had a couple dozen cases of predators going feral, and even fewer victims (since most of the predators afflicted by the drug were quickly captured and \"disappeared\"). This is in a city of several million inhabitants, so the odds of being victimized were incredibly small - and so taking action to protect yourself against that \"threat\" isn't a rational response, but one driven by fear and prejudice. The closest real-world analogy, I think, is not to feminists' views on men but to Trump et al.'s views/comments on Muslims."

If I say Zootopia is a million times better than Secret Life of Pets and that Secret Life is animated garbage, the first thing you're going to notice is that one of these films hasn't been released yet.

We cannot currently compare the two movies now and Ghostbusters has nothing to do with this movie. "

On top of the cute comment, there's also Nick joking about how emotional bunnies are (a female stereotype), and also at the end, Nick asks, \"Are all bunnies bad drivers?\" Which is another blatant reference to a popular stereotype. Also, throughout the movie Hoppes is berated for being ambitious, and told that she's essentially not big/fast/smart enough to try at being an officer, which could be a statement about encouraging young ladies to be more ambitious. Idk, I saw the rest of the movie commenting more on racial issues, but for Nick and Hoppes I sensed a different tone. I could be wrong though, and I definitely see the other side, and honestly the writers most likely left it intentionally ambiguous so that everyone could take something different from it."

The 1960s? Race relations in Belgium? I don't think there's a reasonable alternative here that would work.    \n  \nAs for biological racism, I pointed out that the movie focuses on biology because it makes the most sense in the context of a film where prey and predators have evolved.  \n  \nIt doesn't particularly matter if the issue is biological racism or some other justification for an unjustifiable ideology. Racism is typically reviled as an unethical point of view. I say unethical because it has nothing to do with one's political views, but rather the character of the individual who holds them. An attempt to portray it as simply an unpopular political view is perhaps divisive, but perhaps it's best to draw a line against things that are clearly immoral. If there is a dividing line, it is only made worse by people who ignore the grievances and frustrations of other people.   \n  \nAs for virtue signaling, I've already addressed it. Do you think that the people who made this film only spoke against prejudice to gain brownie points? I think it's possible to try to look good and to do the right thing. These are not mutually exclusive. Also, what exactly is wrong with the desire to appear virtuous? It's much better than the desire to appear un-virtuous. It's a strange critique against a person--\"I dislike your message because you just want to look virtuous in front of others.\" It has no bearing on the merit of the message itself and it assumes that wanting to appear good is a bad thing without looking further into it.  \n  \nHonestly, people who see a children's film arguing against contemporary racism and think its controversial are not the sort of people I understand nor agree with. Racism in America exists. That is a bad thing. Speaking out against it is an admirable thing to do. It's only divisive to someone who doesn't already feel alienated by racism in the first place."

It's a big Earth and Zootopia was cited being the first place where the animals came together. It's possible that the entire world isn't civil or connected. So it makes sense that there's isolation with the world outside, even the outskirts. \n\nAlso, even the backwoods rabbits/creatures didn't know much about the night-howlers. It just so happened that someone ate one and bit someone.

From what knowledge they did have, it was seen as a possible threat, not a definite one: They weren't dealing with the concentrated dose. \n\nStill, someone in the city *did* know about the plant. The otter botanist. He was trying to warn others about it (the taxi driver said he kept going on about it) but was shot with the concentrated dose.

Recall how the media interacted with Judy at her press conference. They swarmed her and asked her extremely leading questions that led her to the conclusion she reached. \n\nFrom that point until her quitting, there were literally zero references to any skepticism by her, reporters or anyone that there was another possible explanation. In this entire sequence where Judy cultivates the guilt that drives her to quit, we are only shown that literally everyone accepts the fact that predators are innately savage. \n\nSocieties don't react to sudden inexplicable changes with a single conclusion; societies generally hold multiple major explanations and solutions for things like this. But we don't even see predators fighting what Judy suggested in her press conference (for instance, Cheetah just gives up his post with no resistance). We aren't shown any second opinions from any of the other detectives or scientists in Zootopia, who should have tons of things to investigate. Any reference that there was another explanation behind animals going savage is deliberately being blocked from the audience. It's because of this lack of skepticism that the transition between Judy's press conference to her quitting her job seems unnatural or forced. \n\nSo who is blocking this skepticism? The writers. Why? Because if they didn't, then Judy would realize that there was more investigating to do and she shouldn't wallow in her guilt without knowing all the facts. What does that mean? Judy wouldn't go home. Why is that a problem? Because that is where the next major plot development occurs.\n\nAnyway, to bring this back to your specific suggestion that she had every reason to believe that everything was over, yes, you're right. But it's because literally no one questioned anything. It's that unnatural lack of skepticism that makes the reason why Judy quit seem forced or manufactured. "

Every single thing talked about in this film rolls around again.\n\nCompare that to Zootopia in which in the first 10 minutes you are told about:\n\n- Judy Hops and her desire to be more than society has etched out for her\n\n- Judy's parents and their desire to keep her safe\n\n- The Rabbit / Fox relationship.\n\n- The predator / prey relationship of Zootopia and how Zootopia is this shining example of a perfect society.\n\n- The police academy\n\nAll of these things come back up, which is fantastic except in that they only set the stage for what happens. Unlike Wreck-It Ralph, none of these things except Judy's desire to be better plays any real part in the main story to such a degree that it changes the world, unlike Wreck-It Ralph.\n\nMy main beef with this film is that there are elements thrown in the film that felt arbitrary. Judy's super hearing, her ability to fight bigger targets than herself, her ability to be fast, her ability to defy the norms of society.\n\nEverything I described in my original post was getting at how these elements were thrown in and NEVER returned to. Characters were introduced for a single gag and never returned to the main story line. They weren't important to the main story even though they played a part in it all. They were used once and thrown away.\n\nAll I want out of a good film is the use of themes and characters that exist for a purpose. I don't want them to be there just to be there. Look at Hot Fuzz and how everything Nick Angel learned in the police academy came back up later in the film and served a purpose.\n\nHis morals, his judgement, his decisions all throughout the early portion of the film all return and play an important role in the entire film. They are pieces of his character that matter. Nothing was thrown in just to say he could do this or that because reasons. No. It had a purpose and those things exist for a reason, which makes his character all the much better.\n\nEdit: Besides, you're just a fox. You must be trying to trick me into believing your shyster ways. XD"

Wreck-It Ralph is most definitely a great movie as well ( I also love video games), but I found Zootopia to hit me harder than Wreck-It Ralph in terms of laughs, tears, and joy. Though I gotta admit I never saw that King Candy as Turbo plot twist coming.\n\n"

He could say the plot was too predictable or that Judy's  character development was poor,  and I would say he has a right to that opinion. The problem I have is the idea that making a movie about race relations in contemporsry America is controversial.  \n  \nFirst, as I said earlier, it's hard to draw a similarity between groups in the movie and races in real life since both prey and predator suffer from forms of problems and discrimination that often occur to black people. It would be easier and a stronger argument if one group were clearly white and the other black,  but that's not the case.  \n  \nSecond,  assuming that it can be viewed as a modern race relations film where one group is clearly white and the other black,  then I would say it isn't controversial or divisive.  \n  \nThis person finds a children's movie to be divisive and controversial. So of course I want to understand why. He says that the message (prejudice is bad) is non-controversial,  but says drawing a parallel with contemporary America is controversial. I don't see how contemporaneous makes it more controversial. I could see it being more controversial if Zootopia were a 1960s version of America with violence,  overt racism,  and segregation. In fact,  racism only becomes less controversial as you go forward on the American timeline. So it almost feels like this movie is condemned to be controversial because they couldn't set it in a less controversial period. That or it isn't the time that's controversial,  but the message. I think that's what really bothers people. And if that's the case,  then the argument against the movie is ideological and not on its artistic merits, which is biased and unfair. "

I know it's a good movie, trust me... in fact it sounds like a GREAT movie, but my problem is this - it's marketed as a FAMILY film, a film for kids to watch with their parents... and it's tied to Disney. My reason for wanting to watch the movie is this - it just looks fabulous. Beautiful animation, great character/world design, clever story and adult humor to give it edge. But to many, many clueless morons in this shitty society, it's just a film about animals wearing clothes. It's film to take the kids to see because the kids want to see it, and anyone who isn't a kid who wants to see it, is looked upon as a man-child. There's still a horrible stigma about adults going to watch animated movies - no matter how many of them get released that become classics over the years, all animated movies will be still be labelled soft kiddie movies and not \"everyone can see it\" movies. If they were marketed better, this disgusting stigma wouldn't exist. The adverts are just going to show the goofy slapstick moments and the cutesy parts, the BBFC will slap it with a big U rating and they'll be plenty of stuffed animals in the stores, and thus all the idiots who haven't done ANY research into it will just think it's just another silly animal CGI movie and nothing else. I've decided that when it comes out here in the UK, I will go see it, because it sounds brilliant - a colourful animated movie making fun of race relations. Hell, 99% on RT? It's honestly far more well-reviewed than I expected."

Sure she's seeing it in the world around her but it would all be coming home because to her its not a general \"conspiracy\" its a specific I lost a friend over this. On top of which she wanted to make the world a better place and not only does she feel she broke it (right or wrong) but more importantly she has no idea what to do to make it better. So very specific guilt and a feeling of helplessness all combined on someone who probably is feeling a sense of lonliness (she does has over 200 brothers and sisters) so she runs to a source of comfort her parents.\n\nWith regards to the press conference specifically Judy is fairly naive and innocent still in a lot of way's hence Nick's coaching which was why she thought she'd done well there till she came down and Nick confronted her.
