Nearly every character was a scientist or engineer. Also, science wasn't some deus ex machina that the writer leaned on to solve problems. The problems that needed to be solved were the whole movie, and the audience member was left scratching their head just long enough to realize how fucked they would be if they were in his shoes, just before he comes up with a (relatively) plausible solution. Science wasn't portrayed as magic, just hard work, as it is in real life.\n\nI really hope this movie inspires people to dream about space exploration. I know it's sort of terrifying and dangerous, but the movie did such a good job of portraying the base on mars I nearly forgot we hadn't actually gone there yet. Hope I live long enough to watch it happen in real life.",

            "body": "So I see this post is already 3 days old but I just saw The Martian and really wanted to chime in with my opinion somewhere, even though it's not likely to be seen.\n\nThis is my first time writing a movie response on this sub so I'm just winging it, forgive me if I have any glaring gaffes.\n\nOkay, to start off, I read the book and really enjoyed it. I know this is a discussion about the movie but I think it's important contextually to know where my head was at coming in to the movie. My favorite things about the book were the characters (Watney especially) and the science. Pretty much all of the characters were likable and charming in some respect. Even foul-mouthed Annie left a warm and fuzzy impression on me. \n\nI will admit that some of the science was a little drawn out and started feeling textbooky but for the most part, it was like a series of riddles that had some ingenious solution and it's captivating to see how it was solved. What's more is that the explanations are, at once, complex but understandable. Hydrazine could be a made up thing for all I care but because of the well-crafted writing, I am able to understand the significance and context in which it is important.\n\nMy least favorite thing about the book is that Watney never really seemed to face any REAL challenge. Yes, that probably sounds crazy but bear with me: Watney is deserted on Mars with what we think is no hope of survival. Yet he always seems to have the tools and knowledge to come out unscathed (Seriously, even the gaping bloody hole from chapter 1 never gets mentioned again). Apart from one incident where he has a momentary \"tantrum,\" Watney is always optimistic and persevering. I quickly learned, while reading the book, that all the danger was an illusion. Watney never loses hope and while I think that's admirable, it made the story less gripping.\n\nThe book definitely reminded me of Michael Crichton's novels but without the danger and excitement. Imagine the movie Cast Away without the 'Wilson' scene. It's pretty hard to, right? The desperation, loneliness, and sorrow of his situation is so viscerally portrayed. It's an iconic movie moment, and I don't think The Martian has any of that. \n\nSo now I'm blending movie and book which is fine, I guess, because they are indeed VERY similar. I won't bore anyone with the tired line of \"but that wasn't in the book!\" ....\n\n....\n\nActually, I will. Because it's very much related to the last point I made.\n\nThe movie cut out a decent chunk of stuff but two scenes in particular only exacerbated the issue of Watney not facing enough challenge.\n\n[Spoiler 1](#s \"Watney breaking the communication he had with NASA while drilling holes in his Rover. I think this was important because Watney really started to feel the weight of his loneliness after this happened.\")\n\n[Spoiler 2](#s \"Uhhh....the sandstorm and FLIPPING THE ROVER. His solution to the sandstorm was genius and the rover flipping would've been quite a marvel on the screen. I'm just surprised they didn't include this.\")\n\nThe movie also downplayed a lot of the other Characters. Mindy in particular was a great character in the book with actual growth. She felt almost irrelevant in the movie. Similarly, Annie had pretty much none of her personal brand of hostility and charm. \n\nI think the movie also lost a lot of the \"Cool!\" factor by not really explaining the science behind some of Watney's decisions. Watching the movie was a bit like watching the book in that it just seemed like Watney had a cheat sheet for every possible problem he could face. The book felt better because Watney was humorously explaining the science behind some of his decisions (Like the night soil, for instance).   \n\nNow, I know the overall tone of this response is negative but I did really enjoy both the book and the movie. In my eyes, though, they both had their letdowns and I think the movie's letdowns were often greater versions of the book's. \n\nIf anyone bothered to read this whole thing, thanks! I know it's not likely to be seen but I wanted to write it anyway. \n\n[The Ending](#s \"The change to the ending was pretty dumb. I don't really mind Lewis replacing Beck but having Watney do the Iron Man thing was idiotic, in my opinion.\")\n",

So most of the audiences keep engaged with the movie even though the subject is really sciency for some people.\n\n* I think Ridley Scott did a job nicely in directing The Martian and I want to give thumbs up to Drew Goddard because he adapted a good source material into a smart and hilarious screenplay.\n\n* I like Matt Damon as Watney because he is competent, funny, and witty. I think that makes his character likeable and makes people easily rooting for him throughout the movie.\n* The entire ensemble cast was also great in The Martian, from the Ares III crew to the people back at NASA and JPL. I think they do not need their big moment in this movie but there are some details, scenes, and dialogues that help you to understand the personalities of each characters.  I think that makes the character development in this movie is fairly balance.\n* I think the other actors and actresses who stands out besides Matt Damon in this movie are Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, and Jeff Daniels. I think the other actors and actresses in this movie also gave a good performance. I want to thank Ridley Scott for this. \n\n* One of the flaws in this movie is I wish that Kristen Wiig\u2019s character is more profound in this movie as a PR director of NASA but I think she did a great job in her role\n\n* The other flaw is from the visual perspectives, this movie did not offer something new but at the same time it is still pretty to look at. Especially the red dessert on Planet Mars.\n\n\nMy final words The Martian is a great movie because most of the entire ensemble cast gave a good performance from a smart and hilarious screenplay. This movie became one of my favorite movie in 2015 and my favorite theatre experience in recent years.\n\nIf I have to give the score to this move, I would give it around **8.0 \u2013 8.5 out of 10**.\n\nSide notes:\n\n* [I disagree with Mark Watney ](#s \"because Disco Music is great in space.\")\n\n* [I think it is cute ](#s \"that Winter Soldier and Invisible Woman (Beck and Johanssen) have a baby together at the end of the movie.\")",

You stick with him for a few minutes see him do stuff, then back to Earth and then when the scene returns to Watney it's back to square one in building that isolation again. I kept thinking how they could have given that Cast Away feel but the NASA scenes are crucial, so it's a bit of a catch-22 in the end in not making it too boring but making it just engaging enough within the time constraints of a movie.",

            "body": "Just came back from seeing the movie. I didn't read the book and I'm not particularly into science. I'm very interested in space topics, though, so I thought I'd at least enjoy it. Sadly, I really did not. \n\nFor a movie about such a truly horrific and desolate situation, I was shocked that its tone was highly upbeat for 90% of the movie.\n\nI found it lacking in tension, emotion, and character development. I thought it was much longer than it needed to be. There were times I was really truly bored. When the last montage came on, I felt myself drift off. There were so many montages. \n\nThe stakes for Mark's survival were never very high. He didn't appear to have much of a family at home that he missed, everything seemed to go very well for him in general. He always had a perfect solution for everything, he was basically super human. The isolation of his situation almost never showed in his character. He got a bit huffy once when something broke and he was a bit emotional when he was finally being rescued, but he showed no signs of insanity, or really, struggle. He had no development and no attachments. \n\nThe sense of humor throughout felt cheesy to me. I cringed a lot. The jokes were like a what a 35 year old science professor picked up from a few months on the Internet. The use of curse words as humor is only funny if you're very young. I can't believe I'm seeing praise for that. \n\nI thought the supporting characters were soulless. When asked if they would spend another bunch of years in space to return for Mark, not a SINGLE one objected? Everything in this universe existed for Mark and no one else. He was the universe's priority  \n\nDonald Glover's character was bizzare, he existed for cheap, immature laughs. \n\nOne thing I will say is, it built a bit of tension when they were finally executing the rescue, but ultimately those scenes left me missing Interstellar and Gravity.\n\nOverall, I really don't get the hype. This movie was boring, often cringe-worthy and lacked tension. The protagonist was cocky, didn't have many emotional attachments to earth and was smarter than everyone. ",

And everyone keeps praising the direction and the adaptation, but I think those are my biggest complaints. The pacing was really bad, especially in the beginning, to the point where a lot of the tension was lost in what were supposed to be very tense scenes. Even the big scene where he gets left behind felt very anticlimactic, partially because of this and partially because the other characters didn't act regretful enough afterward. A lot of scenes suffered like this; the crew finding out he was alive, the supply rendezvous above earth, the crew deciding they're going to rescue Watney, etc. The whole movie just felt rushed, even though it was 2.5 hours long. \n\nSome of the things I didn't like:\n\n* \"I need a map!\" So he goes to the cafe and pulls a picture of mars off the wall. You really don't have a map of mars? At NASA? In the middle of a mars mission?\n* \"And that's if nothing goes wrong.\" <Jeff Daniels basically winks at the camera>\n* I'm fairly sure you can't use human feces as fertilizer because of the protein in it. The reason we use cow's is because they're herbivores. I could be wrong. \n\n* Donald Glover played his character so over the top that it just felt like a cartoon character wandered into the set from a different movie\n\n* Johanssen and Beck's relationship kinda came out of nowhere. Even if that happened in the book it was poorly realized on film and came across as a shoehorned romance subplot\n\nI guess most of these complaints are minor, but I was disappointed by the movie. Don't get me wrong, I liked it. It had some great and hilarious moments, and it was just really pretty in general, but it's far from the perfect film everyone in this thread is making it out to be. I wouldn't put it in my top 10 of the year. ",

            "body": "Pretty bland movie imo. Granted it's a tough book to adapt like this. The Watney storyline's original format would have been closer to a found footage film, but the problem there is that the appeal there is fairly limited. His character doesn't change all on Mars, so it's literally just watching this mary sue-ish character solve every problem he's presented with and the way that is approached is through science that goes over the head of 98% of the audience which leads goofy pirate ninja bits where the audience just tunes him out until he goes back to talking about something interesting. Pretty much masturbatory material for engineers who like to fix everything on their car with duck tape. So obviously, that approach is out. Too limited of appeal, too flat a story, etc.\n\nSo what it looks like they tried to turn it into a vaguely more Hollywood story, and managed to avoid hitting any of the really interesting aspects of either world. They leave out 99% of the science (because the audience won't give a shit) but you're left with a boring mary sue quasi-nerd trying to survive in a story where it would be completely out of tone for him to just die alone on the planet. We're not exploring the emotions of someone surviving alone on Mars, we're just watching a dude solve problems. So ultimately you know he's going to make it and the story doesn't even have the balls to kill anyone to actually make space a legitimate threat. It's just not that kind of story.\n\nThey even forget they took out the science, which leads to scenarios where they don't explain how he farms potatoes on Mars, but when the Hab blows, they mumble the book's reasoning why he couldn't farm anymore. It's like delivering the punchline of a joke when you forgot to say the set up for the joke.\n\nI'm on the fence as to whether or not it was worth going. I didn't get into the book from the perspective needed to fully enjoy it, and the movie (IMO) doesn't have any perspective to really enjoy it. Flat character, simple plot, and I saw it in 2D so I can't say whether or not the 3D visuals made it worth it like Avatar. The handful of tracking shots in 2D weren't that amazing and I was wondering if it was just a recolored real location or entirely CGI during most. During the montage sequence, I honestly realized you could tell the entire story with *just* one long continuous montage without actually losing anything really. I'm not sure that's a good thing.",

Do a minute of Mars rock collecting, then let the storm blow. \n* Show. Don't tell. The shot with the astronauts leaving Mars and having that empty seat between them. Shivers down my spine. Another good example was his visual demonstration of the rationing. We hear numbers about cutting rations and it's all abstract. Then he dissects his portion on the plate, and everyone understands: Oh snap!\n* I was constantly at the edge of my seat. Problems and complications were piling up, but not in an obnoxious \"Really? What next?\" way, it all seemed to follow naturally. There was no Deus Ex Machina, and there was no Diabolus Es Machina either. Well, except obivously there's a scene where guy says: \"Blablabla, so it's tight but we'll make it if nothing bad happens\". I go \"Dun dun dunnnnn\" under my breath and, sure enough, next scene the airlock blows.\n* Comic relief was added in a great, humane way. When he exhales \"Fuck Mars\". When Mars mission director guy wonders about how the \"Are you fucking kidding me\" was meant, oh man. But, luckily, it's not all goofy and cocky and Mark gets emotional and isn't just always above it all and detachedly quipping around.\n* I kinda felt like the Chinese missile cooperation was a bit hamfistedly thrown in for the Chinese market? \n* The scene where astrodynamics guy explains the maneuver... well, while we probably need this for the audience (again, show, don't tell), I'd like to think that in reality everyone at NASA understands enough about this sort of thing that you don't need an explanation with people representing planets and staplers representing spaceships... It felt a bit condescending to the NASA media woman. \n* Man, from now on every computer program I write will finish with a flashing screen informing me that my CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT.

The film constantly moves back and forth between Mars and Earth. I felt like it took the drama away from Mark being on Mars and focused it more on NASA trying to find a way to get him home. I was unable to feel tension in many scenes because the audience usually knew if something would fail/succeed. There were many parts of the movie that you could tell there was a larger backstory (book) because some characters had specks of development that seemed out of place. The strongest parts of the movie involve Mark, but unfortunately the movie focuses on semi-cliche space-rescue drama. ",

What we got instead was an incredibly fun romp on Mars, and a feeling leaving the cinema I haven\u2019t felt in quite a while. A feeling of \u201c\u2026yeah I really damn enjoyed that\u201d. \n\n\u201cFun romp\u201d sorta gives a false impression though, doesn\u2019t it? It seems to say that it\u2019s all \u201cHaha, let\u2019s go to Mars and do shit and dance and make friends with weird space people and shove these space seeds all the way up your butt, Morty\u201d. I suppose the word that would best describe this movie is \u201coptimistic\u201d. If there\u2019s a gripe to be had with it is that this man seems a bit too \u201cah let\u2019s not too be too down about it\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t have objected to a few more scenes of just him being absolutely god damn depressed over his situation. Ridley Scott is known for drawn out emotional moments so this wouldn\u2019t have been too bad. However if there\u2019s a defense (and there is one) is that it does help the pacing of the movie. Comparisons to Interstellar will be inevitable (and boring) but they\u2019re not completely without merit. Interstellar\u2019s only around 20 minutes longer than Martian but U feel like the latter accomplishes a lot more with a lot less when it comes to its story. \n\nThis is done, in part, with it\u2019s pretty damn wonderful screenplay. Being (even more) controversial for a second, Cabin in the Woods seemed a bit too on the nose for my liking, but it was still a very enjoyable time. Goddard knows how humans talk. Not by bombarding with us with philosophical speeches that analyses the movie for us, but with genuine exchanges and laughs. The Martian is the kind of movie that sees a black hole and doesn\u2019t go \u201cand here we find ourselves travelling into the heart of eternal darkness\u201d or whatever, it goes \u201coh fuck, that\u2019s a black hole. shit.\u201d \n\nThis is one of the reasons I\u2019m so willing to look over any gripes I have with the movie, which is also kinda why I don\u2019t really list many here. It\u2019s because it\u2019s been so damn long since I\u2019ve just been this engaged with a movie. There\u2019s this notion, an offensive one, I think, that a movie that knows it\u2019s stupid is good. But say this to any director and they\u2019d probably get rather upset. Fury Road took a lot of incredibly clever choices with its execution. Then Doug Walker will go \u201cit\u2019s a very fun dumb action movie\u201d. This goes for Pacific Rim as well. The use of music and colours and visuals are all very wonderful, then it gets dismissed as being stupid. Ridiculous would honestly be a better term. But doesn\u2019t \u201cdumb\u201d almost seems synonymous with \u201cchildish\u201d? Children aren\u2019t stupid (okay, they\u2019re stupid, but they\u2019re a lot smarter than we give them credit for). Appealing to your inner child doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s dumbing down, not at all. It means it reaches into that irrational part of your mind that\u2019s filled with wonder and excitement and exploits it to the point where you\u2019re genuinely surprised a movie or TV show or whatever like it exists. \n\nWhat does this have to do with Martian? Because I feel like saying \u201cdoesn\u2019t take itself too seriously\u201d is a very stupid thing to say, almost ironically so. Of course Scott Pilgrim took itself seriously. It took itself seriously because Edgar Wright took it seriously, the actors put their hearts into it, Chris Evans was having the god damn time of his life doing his very small role. If they didn\u2019t take it seriously then yes, it would be a \u201cdumb popcorn flick\u201d. But it isn\u2019t. This is why we seem to have more people spend hours analysing different aspects of Pacific Rim than Transformers. \n\nThe Martian is an incredibly well made movie with great acting, visuals, all the team put their heart and soul into it. This is a very serious movie. It\u2019s also a funny movie. That\u2019s the beauty of movies, and probably well constructed art in general. It can be all of these things. ",

It kept up the same storytelling technique as Age of Ultron where everything (in broad terms) only happens so that the next thing can happen. Don't get me wrong, Matt Damon pretty much nailed it along with everyone else. Terrific cast (even though I wish they would have allowed Kristen Wiig to be more in-you-face as in the book); one the best ensembles in a good long while.\n\nI also didn't care for the soundtrack. Why did Ridley Scott feel he had to use so James Horner-y music to try and invoke grandiose feelings near-constantly? Mark Whatney is a space pirate and not a constantly touchy-feely Interstellar character! I wish the soundtrack would have helped perpetuate that sentiment instead of going for (for me) mushy.\n\nThe movie (for me) was to be about human ingenuity and application of science, displayed in this case by Mark Whatney, and instead it became something else. An amalgam.\n\nTo round it off: after having seen Prometheus and The Martian [this](https://youtu.be/-tGL-buZ94Y?t=8) is what I wanted to say to Ridley.",

A real storm on Mars would be about enough to make a flag flutter briskly. Andy Weir *did* acknowledge that the knew that when he wrote it, but was just taking fictional license.\n\n--Watney and the Hermes crew spend more than enough time exposed to the lethal flux of solar radiation for one or more of them to have a very high likelihood of developing cancer.\n\n--The whole notion of growing potatoes in Martian soil--even fertilized by poop--is almost certainly bogus. Martian soil contains toxic levels of perchlorates, and if the potatoes grew at all, they'd likely be poisonous.\n\n--The design of the Hermes is wrong. You cannot spin one part of a spacecraft for artificial gravity, while other parts remain \"stationary,\" there is nothing for the stationary parts to anchor to in space, they would also spin. You could counteract that with constant thrust (*maybe* with gyros, haven't done the math), but it would require a constant expenditure of fuel. You must either spin everything or nothing.\n\n",

Capturing the atmosphere and tone of the novel to a pinpoint, the cast and crew of the film were able to bring jaw-dropping visuals, witty writing (albeit some lines thanks to Weir's masterful novel), and some well-placed emotion, the gripping story of Mark Watney is brought to the big screen in the best way possible. \n\nAlthough there were many intense moments from the book that were sacrificed for the sake of time, as well as many of the hilarious lines being cut to bring it to a PG-13 level, it works. Everything about it works. If you're looking for time to kill, want to see an intense story or don't think The Martian can live up to the success of 2013's Gravity or 2014's Interstellar, think again. \n\nAnd the 3D is actually good. \n\n9.3/10",

The cast was solid, glad to see Donald Glover get a shot at a big budget movie and he was good in the few scenes he was in. Ridley Scott has done it again.

The book has very weak characterisation and visualisation - but it is very strong on the science and pacing. The movie has pretty bad pacing issues (it really makes Watney's struggle seem far to easy in comparison to the struggles back on earth) but actually gives the story a strong visual identity across the board (from Mars, to the characters etc.)\n\nOne of the most powerful moments in the film was actually near the end where it cuts forward 7 months and you see the physical toll it has taken on Watney. It is never expressly described in the book just how ravaged he is. I also feel it delivered a stronger ending than the book. The book ends very abruptly but the film gives some closure, utilising a speech that Watney gives early on in the book as the closing statement of the film. It was more powerful, I felt.\n\nThat said, the movie cut out a lot of good moments and brushed over a lot of details that really made the story in the book tense. For instance, it omitted some of the struggles with his rover journey to the MAV and really that whole third act seemed far too easy for Watney in the film. I also didn't like how it altered Watney's rescue either.\n\nOverall, it was a great movie and a great book that really compliment each other to fully flesh out a brilliant story and concept.",

I was a bit disappointed that they didn't keep the part where he shorts out pathfinder or the rover crash towards the end but I understand it was to probably keep flow and keep the pace fast. I'll even forgive them taking out the fantastically detailed scientific explanations that Andy Reid gives in the book because it was so faithful otherwise. \nAs for the movie itself Matt Damon did a fantastic job portraying Watney, I really enjoyed him and his chemistry with the other cast who also did an awesome job. The visuals were  gorgeous, i really believed that we were seeing Mars for real. I saw the 3D version and I thought it added so much to the movie, the sandstorm was so impressive in 3D with all the particulates flying out of the screen. I just loved how the movie completely immersed me the entire 2 and a half hours without making it feel that long. I give it  a 9/10",

The only spot where they really went the wrong way was the iron man stuff at the end. Even as I read that part I was like, no way would that work. I hope they don't seriously do this because that would be terrible. And of course in the book they all treat that suggestion like what it was, a joke that would have zero percent chance of working in real life. So when he did iron man with ridiculous effectiveness, that was pretty dumb IMHO. Also I didn't really like that Lewis was the one to go out and get him. The whole, I'm the commander so I have to do this myself struck me as weak and not really representative of what a commander of a mission would do.

I geeked out on the scientific approach to this movie.  The only SLIGHT criticism I have is that the Hermes rescue mission went almost too perfectly.  I understand that the math worked out, but the only mishap was that the ship and velocity were slightly off.  I expected more to go wrong...and him flying to her by cutting a hole in his suit was a little \"out there\" even for my taste.

But, later it passed the threshold, got too slow and I started noticing everything that's wrong and remembering everything that was bullshit as shit. \n\nAnd the movie didn't touch on his psychological state, well, implied a little, but it should've been a good part of the movie. \n\nCould've been better. 7/10 bullshit broke the amazing immersion from visuals etc. and there was a ton of bullshit. Some of the bullshit was good, but they went way overboard.  Also, the dialogue is so fucking crap. ",

The movie as a whole felt incomplete, as though some parts were missing and questions unanswered. Why did the Chinese space agency suddenly want to help? Why was it a unanimous agreement to give them the rocket? Also, where's Russia? I thought the Martian atmosphere was thin enough to fly a rocket using a tarp, how could the storms get so severe to the point it's enough to knock a rocket over? And sudden romance near the end?\n\nI do agree it's very pro science but in terms of a movie it's throwing a bunch of numbers. As an example, most people don't know how fast 5 or 10 m/s is and don't have the mental math skills needed to convert that. Lots of numbers throwing around to sound sciency but to me it seemed more like a gimmick. \n\nOverall, a good movie given it was a book adaptation and would recommend others to see it, but I wouldn't go see it again any time soon. Perhaps the book will answer my questions.",

Felt like it fixed a lot of what I really disliked about the book, putting it into that rare category of films I think are better than the source book.\n\nI love that they toned down Mark's internet-pandering sense of humor. It was still there, but it wasn't too much.\n\nI love that they wrote in more moments of emotion. The book is entirely lacking any emotion outside of smart-ass jokes, so it was great to see moments of Mark breaking down. It didn't destroy his will to survive or his scientific outlook, but it did what the book didn't, which is remind me that he's still human.\n\nI love that they lightened up on not only the things that go wrong during the ordeal, but the explanation of how he fixes those things. It made the story feel much more balanced.\n\nMy one nitpick, and it was minor, was that I thought Donald Glover and Kristen Wiig were poor casting choices. They were distracting. They're not enough of character actors to *become* their characters in the small amount of screen time they had, so they felt like celebrity cameos more than anything else. People in my theater actually chuckled when Wiig first appears on screen. Like not at anything she said, but just that she was there. I also thought the first scene with Glover was too over the top slapstick. Felt forced. I was almost expecting him to leave the room Kramer style with a laugh track added.\n\nOverall, great movie. I was hopeful that it would take what I liked from the book and improve on everything I didn't like from the book, and it seems to have pulled it off. ",

Does every goddamn Hollywood film have to somehow start with a woman making a decision that ends badly? They did well making her commander and all but fuck, it's always gotta be us females who fuck it all up, even if we are supposedly the authority/head in charge. Same happened with Gravity.\n\n* I was informed that in the book, the commander saves Damon's character all by herself. Why was it changed and honestly was \"lol I'm Iron Man\" the best they could come up with?\n\n* Sebastian Stan's character was literally useless? Did he have anything to do except look tired?\n\n* The answers were all just handed to them? Like they'd be all \"Shit how do we get over this hurdle. Oh here, here's the answer.\" I didn't feel challenged at all, it was a \"switch your brain off\" movie for the most part.\n\n* One NASA astronaut says to another NASA astronaut: \"In English, please!\" - are you serious??\n\n* This thread agrees with me: the best scenes were the brief moments where the film took the situation seriously. Specifically when Damon broke down before he launched into space at the end, and when his life hung in the balance after he put up the tarp over the blown apart airlock, as he tried to count potatoes. Those two moments were fuckin' great. Shame the whole film wasn't more dire like that. \n\n* The location shots of Mars were great. \n\n* The ending was the most cringeworthy thing I've ever seen, starting with the pointless \"hey there\" to a plant growing on Earth, to the pointless classroom scene, to the pointless Sebastian Stan character having a pointless baby with the almost pointless Kata Mara character, while we watched a pointless space launch since we all knew the film was about to end and we were watching anonymous unnamed characters blast off.\n\n* A \"match the actor on screen to their name\" credit sequence? What is this, the 90s? I was expecting the film to end on a freeze frame of Damon doing the Fonz before a dance off during the credits.\n\n* I Will Survive during the credits............................\n\nOkay, I really didn't enjoy this film.

Seriously, what kind of theater will sell me a pizza without anyplace to put it? \n\nthe movie, however, was freaking amazing.  Well attended, not at all jaded or blase.  There was really no bad guy except nature.  It was fantastic and unexpected and fresh in all the right ways and the cast was exactly as fantastic as I had hoped they would be. ",

Not a big deal though. Also, from the book I had the impression that he brought Pathfinder inside the hab to take the pictures, but I might be wrong on that.\n\nThe tone of the movie is dead on, Matt Damon knocked it out of the park as Watney, and the rest of the cast was amazing as well.\n\nIn fact, the movie added something that I felt the book was lacking: an epilogue. Which was fairly short, sweet, and to the point.\n\nHonestly, the only part that bugged me was how the pictures were transmitted from Pathfinder/Sojourner. Why would they come in the form of like 8 little pictures, scattered around, and then move themselves to the right place to form a weird, scattered, panoramic thingy?

Do the math: Say the opening is six feet across (please excuse the English units), for a cross sectional area of roughly 4000 square inches.  Normal air pressure is 15 pounds per square inch (NASA used pure oxygen for some vehicles, but the space station uses regular air).  The total pressure would be about 60000 pounds, or about 270 pounds per linear inch of the tarp if it took the form of a hemispherical cap.  Except Mark stretched it much tighter than that - something like a quarter inch of bulge for the first inch across the opening - increasing the tension to something like 1000 pounds per inch.  Hard to believe.  And there's no way a tarp stretched that tight would actually *flap in the wind*.  Incidentally, the hab would be designed for loads in tension, but that uber-tarp needed a tightening band that would apply a tremendous *compression* load (100000 pounds?) to the flange around the opening, that would tend to make it buckle (at least until the air pressure built up).",

The consequences of stress what body experience from space travel and  being on planets with different gravitation would likely prevent an astronaut making another trip to Mars right after the previous one, like in case of Martinez in the movie. \n\nI think the list can grow further with comments left by people who more scientifically knowledgeable regarding the matter. \n\nI think materials, like screen play, plot  and so on, of sci-fi movie of this rang and budget should get more rigorous look by scientists related to the field before going into movie. Otherwise any person who had at least general school education can see all this inconsistencies. \nI'm fine with spaceship with a fusion engine. Because it's a fiction genre. Yes it's not available right now but there is a slight possibility what one day such engines would propel future spaceships. But why would you disregard physics laws and technology what already known to humanity, turning sci-fi movie into a fable for kids. \n\nBTW what sci-fi movie do you recall that by your opinion is most realistic.

He proved that food could be grown in Martian soil--no self-respecting scientist would just decide not document or explain that process.  Especially a botanist.  Once he regains communication he's in the habit of making his daily vlogs, which again probably help to keep him sane.  Obviously NASA needed to be doing a lot of talking amongst themselves, since their role was collaborative problem solving.",

Too many characters in this movie were constantly working their ego and everyone thought they were a comedian. After while, when the camera cuts to a character I would be instinctively bracing for a 'one-liner' because that's how predictive the writing got.\n\nMatt's character seemed like he cruised through his situation with no psychological struggle what's so ever. Mars never felt 'vast' and he never showed to be affected from 'being alone'. Other than the food supply he had, he basically survived on jokes and constant intolerance for disco music (this joke was used more than four times).\n\nDonald Glover's appearance was a pleasant surprise but was again ruined with cheap jokes and over-quirky personality. The scene where he has an epiphany for the rescue mission, trips over as he was getting coffee was so pointless and unnecessary that it made me angry.\n\nThe way the film portrayed the Chinese reminded me of the Transformers Age of Extinction and the Chinese variant of the Iron Man 3. Horrible execution and almost cartoonish acting. The actor chosen to play the head of space program in China also had a horrible foreign accent and butchered the Chinese language.\n\nI can go on and on, all these small things cheapened the experience took me out of immersion. The comedy elements acted like a series of pain killers for every time something was going bad.",

From the context of having watched it after the Golden Globes where it won awards I was left wondering how it could win anything and I'm really not understanding the praise for the film although most people in this sub seem to have read the book (which i haven't).  Ironically, it won the Golden Globe for best comedy or musical probably because IMO it's so laughably bad!\n\nMatt Damon literally had two scenes where he appeared bothered by his situation (listening to the tarp flapping in the wind and sitting in the launch vehicle) that called for some actual dramatic acting.  The rest of the time he is a caricature.  Did he not have any family or friends?  Did they only remember late in the film that his character would start to look a bit shabby after a while?\n\nThe supporting cast....yes, soulless.  Why was Kristin Wiig's character even there?  When you need to figure out a plan to rescue someone stuck on Mars where does a PR person fit into the picture?  Donald Glover only existed to provide a rescue plan that only his superior genius could come up with thanks to being able to plug his laptop into the NASA super-computer (cringe).  It's a good thing his typically beepy, blippy, boopy non-existent software told him CALCULATIONS CORRECT right there on the screen.  Because NASA wouldn't have an entire team of people trying to figure this out, right?  And it's great that he explained his plan to the directors at NASA who perhaps don't quite understand how a gravitational slingshot works.  And for some unexplained reason they didn't tell some other guys at NASA who thought they were still trying to safely bring home the other astronauts.  And how about that predictable rocket explosion?  Such tension!  Lucky the Chinese offered help and that NASA didn't ever consider seeking help from Europe or Japan or perhaps one of the now many private space companies.\n\nHaving lived on this planet for 38 years I can't ever remember an event that transfixed me so much that I felt compelled to go to some public space and watch a big TV with lots of other people instead of just watching it on my own TV.  But that's Hollywood sense of reality for you.  And when many disaster films follow the simple premise of whatever can go wrong does go wrong, it's best to have a scene explaining the situation they are in and what the best possible outcome is and then ending it with someone saying 'As long as nothing goes wrong'..........cue the next scene with ominous music playing and lo and behold an inexplicable explosion and yeah, something did go wrong and oh look there goes your only renewable food supply (massive cringe).\n\nA movie that grates ones nerves almost the entire time is a big disappointment.  This is what it did to me.  I was really looking forward to this film because I love sci-fi and science in general.  I don't know how well the science checks out but it doesn't matter because it doesn't change the fact that it's wrapped up in over two hours of contrived and predictable rubbish.  Half an hour into it I was contemplating turning it off, it was like Armageddon all over again.  I cannot recommend this film to anybody.",

I really really loved Interstellar and got to work on the sound for a little while, so I watched it at least 10 or 12 times from start to end.  It really grew on me and provided pretty great discussions and thoughts.\n\nThe Martian though...it was like the sitcom light version of a space movie. The disco running joke, the witty repertoire, the bouncy pace of Watney's progression-it just didn't work for me.  Yes, I'm guilty of being in too deep with Interstellar, but I think given that 2 of that movie's stars are in this one too, ...and it's about space, ..and it's about being stranded....I think my comparisons are reasonable.  Not a bad movie at all, just...not what I was expecting.",

In The Martian, women are in positions of authority and never questioned about those positions, and they make critical contributions to the plot. \n\nThe fact that the protagonist is male makes it nearly impossible for a plot-relevant conversation to not center around a male, but there are no shoehorned love-triangles or any other tropes that lessen the independent value of the female characters as individuals. \n\nIf your only measure of how \"feminist\" a film is is the Bechdel test, then The Martian fails, but ultimately that's a really hollow, minimalist measure of \"feminism\". A more holistic understanding of the film would likely see it in a very good light in that regard.",

My favorite parts were the detailed science descriptions and how Weir went into meticulous detail about every goddamn procedure Watney had to do to solve problem X, avoid catastrophe Y, and move on. My favorite part was when Weir described the actual chemistry calculations Watney used to produce water from hydrazine. It felt like my year of AP chemistry was validated by just that one moment.  \nBut I agree that the sense of place and character is a bit glossed-over. I didn't get the sense I was delving into anything very rich while I was reading the book, although for the life of me I could not put it down. I thought the character of Watney, with the combination of his nerdy wit and his powerful will to survive, was compelling, but at the same time I wanted to learn a bit more about him.  \nIMHO, the movie does all the stuff the book doesn't do perfectly. The nuance and pathos Damon brings to Watney more than makes up for any lack of detailed talk about feelings or backstory, which would probably ruin the story. When we see the NASA scientists and their conference rooms and command centers, we feel more grounded in the reality of the situation. The movie also does a great job of portraying the supreme desolate beauty that is Mars, balancing it with a sense of urgency and danger, all without milking it too much. There's a few panoramas of Martian landscape and views of the far-off stars, but they're done very tastefully and the film remains grounded with small-angle shots of just Watney and his gear. Just one man, and one planet. One damn great movie, too.",

You basically have a ship against a space background which provides no frame of reference for speed.\n\nI think with the book it's kind of easier to imagine that things are moving fast.

He calculates the number of litres of water he can make, the amount of potatoes he can grow with the space that he has, he even creates his own unit of energy called the pirate-ninja to make his final rover journey easier.  This level of quantitavie detail is absent in the film, although there is still a very high level of qualitative detail.\n\nThere are a few minor changes to Mark's character. He swears a lot more in the book. He is also a botanist and a mechanical engineer in the novel. He might still be a mechanical engineer in the film, although he only ever claims to be a botanist. \n\nHe gets into far less trouble in the movie than he does the book (this is what I appreciated most about the adaptation).  The book was written as a serial, with chapters being released on Andy Weir's website periodically. It means that the book falls into this kinda crappy rhythm where at the end of every chapter Mark falls into some sort of great peril, and he manages to get out of it fairly inconsequentially.  A lot of his escapes are much less interesting than the problems he solves earlier on. \n\nThe film dispenses with most of this false jeopardy, a change I appreciate a lot. \n\nThe biggest change, and the only change I didn't like, comes in the climax. Spoiler tags from here on:\n[Climax Spoilers](#s \"In the novel, Watney suggests the 'Iron Man' technique, which the crew dispense as stupid and tell him not to do it. They use this as inspiration to blow the airlock. This brings them close enough so that Beck can rescue Mark. The same thing occurs in the movie; Mark suggests the idea, which the crew dismiss, they blow the airlocks. However, they're still some distance from Watney. He decides to use the 'Iron Man' technique to get himself to Commander Lewis, who has taken Beck's role\")\n\nEdit: When I wrote this I thought that you hadn't read the book, but judging by your other comments, it seems that you have.

There wasn't enough build up to the speech where they announced that he died, and it was so poorly delivered. I never actually felt any real tension outside of the counting potatoes scene that everyone brings up. The movie was close to three hours but you know the whole time he's going to survive so it just felt prolonged. I'm also pretty sure it was spoiled in the trailer that the crew would save him. So as soon as Gambino's character went EUREKA! It was obvious. So much of it felt predictable. Maybe I'll add more to this later if you even care, but there was a lot about the movie that felt like it could have been done better. Like the fact that the entire movie matt damon never lost any weight, it was really bothering me, and it bothered me more after the terrible cgi/body double.I'm not looking for Christian Bale in the Mechanic, but some kind of commitment. Matt looked healthy most of the movie and along with how positive he was the whole time it really broke my immersion, and it seemed like a bit of a cop out. They even tried making him look shrunk in the suit but his head was still healthy and normal looking. Just because he grew a beard and put some shit in his teeth doesn't make it look any more believable.\n\nI had planned on reading the book before I even heard about the movie, and now I really regret not doing it.

In the Galileo, the spun and despun sections were of *greatly* unequal masses (most of the mass was in the spun section), and the design allowed a very low-friction bearing between the two sections. None of that applies in a large spinning ring designed to carry people and simulate gravity. \n\nThe relative masses of the sections is crucial in this problem. Try this: take a small cylinder and put an electric motor in one end and the the batteries to run it inside, then attach a string to the other end, and dangle the thing from the string and turn on the motor. Attach a paper disc or something very light to the shaft as a payload, and turn the motor on while dangling the unit from the string (this simulates the unit being in zero-G). You'll note the disc spins quite nicely, and the cylinder almost not at all. That's essentially what Galileo did.\n\nNow replace the paper disc with something that weighs approximately the same as the motor cylinder unit and try it again. Both the cylinder and the payload will counter-rotate.\n\nNow, one more time, but this time with a payload MUCH heavier than the cylinder. Now, only the cylinder will spin. \n\nFurthermore, there was no internal movements of mass in either section of the Galileo, which would put stress on the bearing. Again, not the case with a large rotating ring.\n\n>although an appropriately low-friction rotating pressure seal is another question. \n\nIf, by \"another question,\" you mean \"changes everything,\" sure. There's simply no way to build such a thing that has an acceptable leakage rate without a LOT of friction.\n",

I could be wrong, though.  I think the scariest part about that one was the notion that eventually people might give up looking, but there's still always a chance you'll see a ship or a plane and get their attention because at least you're on Earth and people know you might not be alive.

He wanted theoretical situations and how you could get out of them. He then added a person to make it less boring. Only later it was put into a book. He focused on how he could get out of the situations, but for the basic story he needed to somehow maroon someone on Mars. So I give him a pass on this because he only made a storm happen because he needed to get his character marooned somehow. ",

Once he overcomes a problem it's basically gone completely. However the movie does address the issues of the HAB blowing up in two ways: 1) the scene where he's counting potatoes and flinches every time he hears the makeshift patch flex (maybe the best scene in the movie), and 2) the entire change of plan that involves him going to Ares 4 was because of the HAB explosion.\n\nThe one legitimate complaint I have about the book is that it's pacing is kinda all over the place. It's mostly the result of the fact that the book was written as a serialized blog entry. Not as a novel. So at times it's like \"and this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened....\" The movie, I thought, did a great job of smoothing that out a bit.",

Alpha particles are actually pretty easy to stop; it's very high energy, but you'd be [shielded from it by a piece of paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle#Energy_and_absorption).\n\nIn this case, (in the book and in what I've been able to find, in reality; I'm an amateur at this, so if someone else knows better, they should correct me) they put the plutonium pellets into little casings, then put the casings in the RTG, so even if the structure of the whole thing cracks, the actual dangerous stuff is still in something that will contain the alpha particles. Still gets hot (and therefore useful for generating power), but actually being next to it would be ok. He's not sitting next to a big block of radioactive material; he's sitting next to a big block that contains little blocks that contain radioactive material.\n\nSo, while Watney's doing something they'd never do, he should be fine so long as he doesn't break open the outer structure of the thing and then break open the little casings. Turns out Los Alamos National Laboratory used ^238 Pu as the power source for RTGs used in pacemakers [that worked for a long time](http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/nmt/nmtdo/AQarchive/05spring/heart.html). The company that made the pacemakers only made 250, but 22 of them were in service for at least 25 years. I presume they only made 250 because someone realized that even if the shielding was relatively easy, maybe *putting plutonium in people's chests* was an iffy idea, even for the '60s.",

It wasn't a big room full of nerds, it was varied and reflective of the scientists I've met. \n\nRegarding the gravity assist, that should be known to them, however thesemanagement guys are career bureaucrats, rather than the practising scientists. It's likely they spent the last 10-20 years looking at spreadsheets of expenses much more than data. Also the manoeuvre was done by a constantly accelerating ship, so is not really a conventional Hohmann elliptical transfer or a purely gravity slingshot. In reality it would take advantage of something called the obereth effect, where the faster a ship is going (being closer to the earth) the more impact full the thrust is on the trajectory. On top of that the trajectory takes into account full N-body effects, which are not so easily explained. I think there is plenty there that has to be explained to them, and justifies that scene being there, even if it isn't as complicated. \n\nAt the end of the day however, it's a film, and the simple visual demonstrations are necessary for the viewing public that aren't scientists. They could have just shown a picture of Wier's simulation (which I think was actually in the background of purnells office), or drawn it on the blackboard. But that wouldn't be memorable or have the humour from Purnell obliviousness to Ted's position as head of nasa. ",

There are plenty like that that are extremely good in their area of expertise, but not tied too tightly into the rest of the world--like working for NASA and not knowing who the Administrator is.  I think the most scientifically inaccurate thing about the movie was the treatment of the RTG (Radioisotope Thermal Generator).  Burying an RTG in the Martian ground has some serious planetary protection issues.  More importantly, an RTG wrapped up in MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation) would get extremely hot and generate no electric power.  It works on the thermo-electric effect that depends on a temperature difference.  In space, the black finned end radiates into cold space, while the plutonium end stays hot.  Overall, a great movie though. ",

He had to keep a chipper mood, but we all know we have moments of weakness. Those moments no one ever sees. But....  We were with him. We should have seen more of those moments. \n\nPurely from a movie making standpoint, his chipper attitude made me feel like he was never in real danger. ",

They made everything look like a cake walk. The explosion when making water just seemed like something to joke about. When the airlock blew off, they completely skipped the rolling of the airlock to give him more time to find someone else's suit in the destroyed Hab. Even showing that he had limited time to get the suit would have helped the scene. Using smoke from his hair to find the hole that caused the explosion! And like you said about making a bedroom. Make it out at least to show that sleeping in the rover fucking sucked, and how great the idea of having a bedroom again was. And then the drilling! 2 minutes a hole in the book... Couple seconds in the movie (not that I wanted them to show the guy drilling for 2 minutes, but at least explain it). Then he didn't lose communication to NASA, come on! You see what I mean? The emotional scenes are great, but they would have been easier to justify had the entire journey been showcased as a near impossible feat rather than just another day at the office. That's my gripe.",

If he wasn't going all the way to Mars then it raises the question of how he returns to Earth by himself. \n\nPending any pretty significant change to how spaceflight works, such as astronauts suddenly getting the opportunity to go on consecutive missions or some sort of spacecraft with greater capacity replacing the Soyuz, there would be no reason for Martinez to be on that flight.

We see big moment survival things, but very few of the day to day trouble shooting he had to do in the book.\n\nI loved the number of times in the book, something would go wrong, he would be freaking out about how he was going to die, then would come back calm and collected and start figuring out/fixing shit.  It gave such a nice contrast between how we would all react initially, and then what he could do once he regained his composure.  I know that a movie run time couldn't allow for everything he had to fix, but maybe just a couple more just to really show how much of a struggle just day to day things could be.\n\n",

Cramming in more would have led to audience fatigue. Having the rover journey focus on his frailty and wasting body just before he has to ride the \"convertible\" into space makes for a stronger emotional payoff when he survives that last, risky sequence. If he'd had multiple close calls on the way there, he'd be too obviously shielded by [plot armor](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor) for us to believe that anything else can go wrong. Note that the exact same events could happen in the book without the same effect because the reader isn't experiencing everything in the span of ~2 hours like the film viewer is. (I think there's a valuable parallel in how Gravity handles its pre-climax moments.)",

(It needs to include a ball bearing to carry the pressurization loads across the joint.) Second, you want to overcome friction to maintain the relative rotation of the two parts of the spacecraft, which you can do with a small electric motor.  Third, you want to adjust the over-all rotation of the spacecraft so that part of it is stationary.  This breaks down into two sub-problems.  First (and probably most awkward) you need to adjust the balance of the rotating section so its natural axis of rotation (the principle axis of inertia with the largest moment) is aligned with and centered on the rotating seal. Second, you'd use thrusters to spin up the spacecraft as a whole, to get the motion of the \"stationary\" part close enough to zero.  \n\nBy the way, the speed of the motor would have to vary to keep the \"stationary\" part in the same orientation.  The movement of people between the zero-g and rotating sections would change the rotational rate.  They would also shift the balance, causing  some slow residual movement, unless you used something more flexible than a single rotating joint.  I think three rotating joints would do it.",

After the collapse of the Soviet Union we were very briefly the only hyper power in world history. We had total will over the world. No one knew what the fuck to think and everyone looked to us suddenly to keep the machine churning. He was in charge of NATO, he was overseeing where Russian nukes were going, he had Israel in his back pocket, China became truly friendly, Vietnam opened relations, South America suddenly became ours. Eastern Europe fractured. No one could even compare to the USA between 1992 and 1998. Bush Sr. held the mantle for a short time, but he was quickly out nearly a year after the Soviet collapse. ",

Nolan's was accurate, but a little too far ahead of where the world is at right now.  In the future, people will see Interstellar as a masterpiece and The Martian will fade into the background.  But in the present, The Martian is a more relatable movie, and it's what people need to see in order to motivate them in the right direction.  I think his brother would appreciate it as well and it would really speak deeply to him.  That isolation on mars, does something to those of us with bipolar type I. ",

Out in the spoke, not touching anything ,the spin would have no effect on you at all.\n\nImagine if the rooms at the end were a full ring, and you could move down there without picking up the angular momentum of the ring (for example, if they started up the spin while you were already in the ring, not touching anything), you would actually sit there floating while the ring zoomed past around you.  The gravity comes from your speed sideways while the ring shape is constantly pulling you 'up'.  Of course, in my example there, the air would eventually transfer enough motion to you via friction that you would get pushed over to the floor and pick up the rotational speed and 'gravity'.",

They use terms that we don't know, and they don't explain them, because we can figure them out from context.\n\nUsually movies and TV shows have one character that is \"the new guy\" that all of the other characters will explain things to, essentially being the reason that things need to be explained, which then benefits the audience. Most of the time, this means characters will explain some complex science thing with a really, really, mind-bogglingly dumb analogy, they are saying it to the character, but they are saying it for our benefit. It feels awkward, and generally leads to experts talking to other experts like they are both in elementary school. In The Martain, there isn't a character for that really (maybe Teddy and Annie a bit?). The person that needs to stuff explained to them is the person viewing Watney's video logs. However, Watney knows that the person viewing the logs will probably be at least a little bit informed about the science of the things he's doing, so he doesn't explain every little thing.\n\nLike they never say what MAV stands for, and we don't absolutely need to know that it's a **M**ars **A**scent **V**ehicle, but we understand that it's the rocket thing he uses to escape. They never actually say was a SOL is, but by the way it's used, a normal person would easily guess that it's essentially a \"space day\" and be happy. They use the term HAB plenty, but they don't explicitly say that it's short for Habitat, because they don't need to. There are tons of other things in the movie. Somehow they also keep it at a level where science-minded people will understand what they are talking about and know it's accurate, and less scientifically-minded people will still get the gist of what they are talking about enough to follow what they are planning.

Hardly makes sense given that the hab is at 1 atmosphere... Things like that just kicked me out of immersion in the movie. And really jarred compared to the generally excellent science in the book.",

The Alien series presents a world where humans travel from world to world and there happens to be a parasitic lifeform. We then see how rational humans deal with encountering these lifeforms through various plot points consistent with the world they exist in. \n\nWe as the audience must be able to believe this is a consistent world with  characters doing believable things within that world or the series goes nowhere. \n\nThe characters of Prometheus and its plot points do not make sense within this future world that we have accepted for the past 36 years (since Alien (1979)).\n\nIt's foolish for me to say that you are wrong for finding enjoyment in this film. But it is equally incorrect for you to assume that the sheer weight of criticism the film receives is some sort of mass delusion you slipped past. \n\n",

The original commenter had a complaint that he felt the movie was too talky. You replied with \"Too talky? Have you read the book?\", as if that's somehow a rebuttal to his complaint. It's not. The faithfulness of the adaptation has no place in film criticism.\n\n>It's absolutely not a flaw.\n\nThat's a personal opinion and absolutely can't be absolute. You could have an argument about whether either the book or movie is too talky, based on whats in them. The content of the book or movie doesn't change, but people's perceptions and feelings towards the content can. I guess you could use the book as a mutual point of reference if you have both read it, and say like \"the book is much more talky than the film\". But to me, that's kind of irrelevant and a pointless exercise. They are different mediums, so a book having a lot of dialogue might work really well, but the movie having even less dialogue could still feel too talky. If you're going to use a comparison while critiquing a film, it's always best to use other films.\n\n\n>Saying that a movie that is based on a book is a separate entity is totally absurd when without said book there would be no movie.\n\nNo, it's not. A movie and a book are two separate works of art, in separate mediums. When critiquing either, you judge them based off their individual merits, not in comparison to each other. A faithful adaptation of great material does not necessitate a great movie (Watchmen IMO), and an unfaithful adaptation of great material does not necessitate a bad movie. How many critics have said \"well, the movie lacked heart, was really slow in parts, and the characters were unlikable, but the book was that way too so 10/10!\"? Zero, because that's unprofessional and really stupid.\n\n>What's the first question 9 out of 10 of them said? Did it ring true to the book?\n\nThis is completely irrelevant. There's a world of difference between asking if something is faithful and asking if it's any good.",

All his crewmates think he is an asshole but they laugh and really like it in a way. He is curious and seems to rush into solutions through the story but making water by burning hydrogen is the only time that him being sure of himself gets him a slap on the wrist by getting burned and ears ringing. His only real flaw seems to represent the flaw of humanity in space which is how it should be. His flaw is that humans are not meant to survive on mars. He constantly needs air pressure, oxygen, water, food, and in higher orders, communication and friendship and works the whole movie to get these things. I enjoy this choice (initially made by the author and confirmed by movie crew) because the movie shows humanity v mars. Mark Watney has a bland unemotional personality type because any american, (because of nasa being the fictional institution involved) man (the majority of audience of this movie or majority of plausible astronauts pick your poison) and well meaning asshole (idealized self reflection of any 18-30 year old engineer or physicist, also in this case maybe redditor). I like the choise without flaws. The characters around humanity's surrogate have personality and flaws enough to make the story interesting (Teddy follows the institutional etiquette, sean bean's character believes in saving fellow man at any cost). The crowds in Times Square were scared and sad and mad for Watney, so he didn't have to waste time being emotional.",

Some good luck, some bad luck.\n\nI think you may be attributing luck to a lot of Watney's critical thinking. He doesn't by pure luck stumble upon the fact that he is heading into a sandstorm which will result in his demise, he sees a problem and reasons it out. He also ran into bad luck he couldn't solve (his loss of communication through Pathfinder) which the movie eschews totally.\n\nThe way he solves all these problems, whether lucky or unlucky, may not seem 'interesting' to you but I am sure they are a major part of the book which most readers enjoy. Each new problem presents a new set of circumstances which have to be overcome, etc. It's like that scene from Malcolm in the Middle where Bryan Cranston starts off fixing one thing and has to fix everything else -- it may be far-fetched that he fixes everything well enough that he survives, but we already know he does. \n\nIn the book the climax is definitely the ascent to Hermes. I thought it would go smoothly since everything and the kitchen sink has already been thrown at Mark, but yet again he is fucked to the point that he should not survive. Instead this time it is the Hermes crew having to improvise, which provides a fitting counterpoint to Mark's half of the story. The pacing seemed fine in the book, but the movie really speeds up a lot of the stuff (understandable given the format) that I think book readers enjoyed the most. ",

Leaving the pizzeria, he sat on a public bench just outside. Next week would be busy. He would be meeting the Ares-6 Engineer. He had read her file, but had never met her in person. He wouldn't get much time to relax after that. The following six weeks would be filled with constant training as he tried to impart as much knowledge as he could. But that was something to worry about later. Right now, he took a deep breath of the fresh air and watched the people go by. \u201cHey, I know you!\u201d Came a voice from behind. A young boy had strayed from his mother. \u201cYou're Mark Watney!\u201d \u201cSweetie,\u201d the boy's mom said, embarrassed. \u201cDon't bother people like that.\u201d \u201cIt's ok,\u201d Watney shrugged. \u201cYou went to Mars!\u201d The boy said, his eyes wide with awe. \u201cSure did,\u201d Watney said. \u201cAlmost didn't make it back.\u201d \u201cI know!\u201d Said the boy. \u201cThat was awesome!\u201d \u201cSweetie!\u201d The mom scolded. \u201cThat's rude.\u201d \u201cSo Mr. Watney,\u201d the boy said, \u201cIf you could go to Mars again, like, if there was another mission and they wanted you to go, would you go?\u201d Watney scowled at him. \u201cYou out of your fucking mind?\u201d \u201cOk time to go,\u201d the mom said, quickly herding the boy away. They receded in to the crowded sidewalk. Watney snorted in their direction. Then he closed his eyes and felt the sun on his face. It was a nice, boring afternoon.",

Which is why they tended to mention the speed difference so often.\n\nI mean at one point they say he's going 42m/s . The average viewer isn't going to realize that that's about 150km/hr or like 93mph.\n\nBecause they don't have that background that would normally whiz by.\n\n----\n\nAnd I think it sort of tried to highlight that at the end sometimes a solution shouldn't be thrown out solely because it sounds idiotic. If it's the only idea that's left, you may as well leave nothing on the table.\n\n---\n\nThe plan more than showed their coordination and co-operation prior to that. \n\nBut much in the same way the guys didn't accurately gauge how high he'd end up reaching with the MAV. Their plan also fell slightly short(Though of course their's was a patchwork idea)",
