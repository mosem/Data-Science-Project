The costumes, the sets, the makeup, the score, the performances, the screenplay, the directing. It feels like every single thing was planned out and executed the way it was planned. \n\nThis is one of the most fascinating films, too. I love how it doesn't just present the events that happened. It knows we know what happened. It focuses solely on the reactions and the emotions of these events. \n\nNatalie Portman pulls off another great performance, on the same level of Black Swan, if not exceeding it. The way she plays the different Jackies, like Jackie the First Lady, Jackie the Wife, Jackie the Mother, Jackie the Widow, and Jackie the Queen. I will be so delighted if she wins another Oscar this year.\n\nLastly, that score is indescribably great. That single, slow, grating pitch shift does wonders for the tone of the film. If the Oscars were good and just, this would win all the awards. ",

Pablo Larrain is such a unique filmmaker, and I can't wait to catch up on the rest of his filmography after seeing this. I just watched his film *Tony Manero,* and I certainly have never seen a filmmaker quite like him. \n\nThis movie is haunting and horrific, and is captured in such a beautiful way. Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard give great performances as two people trying to keep their castle from crumbling beneath their feet. Levi's score works perfectly for this and adds another layer to this already emotionally twisted story. \n\nWhile it's an emotionally strenuous film, I can't wait to see it again.\n\n[Also here's a great clip of Aronofsky talking about picking Larrain to direct this project.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkyBkWf80SA) \n\n*edit: just rewatched the clip. It's not that great of a clip. More like an okay clip about Aronofsky picking Larrain, but I will leave it here.*",

They're really loud, that was Jackie Kennedy's orders, for them to beat the drums as hard as they could. \n\nThe other was Air Force One and the other planes, she planned for them to fly as low as possible which they did. Like the drums beating over and over again, with everyone feeling their vibrations - the planes had a similar effect. \n\nShe wanted everyone there to feel her pain. Her wearing the blood soaked dress, everything was a projection of the emptiness that was left behind after Kennedy died.\n\nBut in the end when he was being buried played a band a somber song, one final tribute to the president. \n\nI just find that really amazing.

I didn't feel moved, I barely felt sympathy for any character, I didn't learn anything new historically, I wasn't in suspense... When the movie finally seems to reveal what it's trying to say, all I could think was \"Well duh... you've been making this point very clearly for an hour now.\" I literally cannot remember the last time I saw a movie that felt this pointless and protracted. I wish I understood why some people loved it so much.  \n  \nI even thought Natalie Portman's acting was weak, despite all the hype \u2014 it never felt like anything other than watching Natalie Portman do an okay (if stilted) impression of Jackie O. I watched some interviews with the real Onassis afterward to see if this movie had somehow given her a different dimension, and instead it just further cemented how little the story or performances had affected me at all: I ended up just feeling like \"nah, they got her wrong.\"",

He's read everything he could on it, and absorbed as much info as he can. He told me as he walked out, \"I've spent literally *years* pouring over this topic, and never once stopped to consider what that experience must have been like for her. That is without a doubt one of the best film experiences of my life.\" \n\nI've never been as invested in the topic but I also thought it was superbly crafted. I was apprehensive towards casting Portman but it's clear that she has poured herself into this performance. \n\nIf you need convincing, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbFt4h3Dkkw) - the original White House tour documentary (start at 6:17). Look at the way JK holds her hands,  pauses between her words, and averts her eyes from time to time, and compare it to Portman's portrayal. I would not have believed [Padme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buyflmtHcHc) could pull something like this off. \n\nHer portrayal aside, Lorraine has organized a lot of moving parts in a very compelling way. So much so that the sound of the gunshot ringing through her head and the following camera glide up and over the back of the limo as Clint Hill clings to the back of it have transitioned from a photo, to an actual experience for me. \n\nWithout a doubt in my Top Five of 2016 - I hope it's not left out of the awards conversation.

This gets a thumbs up, not too enthusiastically, but it is worth a look.\n\nPluses:  This avoids the trappings of the normal bio-pic and focuses on the post assassination.  Billy Crudup as the journalist is a device to frame the story with flashbacks to the CBS TV tour Jackie gave in 1961.  Best scenes for me were with John Hurt as a priest.  Some sequences of the film are absolutely great, much credit to Pablo Larrain and a score that took lots of chances.\n\nMinuses - Narrative sometimes lost momentum and story seemed to get lost.  Thought Natalie Portman forced it a bit, especially with the White House tour which really wasn't that important.  Some of the scenes with Billy Crudup also felt flat or forced.\n\nLarrain is a very interesting choice to direct this film and this paid off in that regard.  Portman does her best with such an iconic character but I've seen her better.\n\n",

I wasn't *too* interested in the subject material and I was mostly going in for Natalie Portman's acting, but it was just so damn interesting on a technical level. The music was strange and a little off-putting, but in a good way (to me). The way the entire movie was shot was intimate and a little chaotic; half the movie was spent right in Jackie's face.\n\nPortman brought so much life to a character that I didn't really know too much about. The subtle anger in her performance was spectacular. Jackie was such an interesting character -- seemingly weak on the surface, but she knows *exactly* how she is viewed and how to use that to her advantage. The scenes between Portman and Crudup were especially great; I loved how assertive Crudup's character was without being too pushy. You could feel the tension in their back-and-forth but also their respect.\n\nI can understand why some people might not like it though, as it was a little slow. The woman next to me in the theater fell asleep and started snoring. I had to wake her up, it was weird.\n\nOverall it is definitely in my top 10 for the year. I *liked* it when I watched it, but it's one of those movies that I enjoyed even more as I reflected on it afterwards.",

            "body": "The guy who played LBJ looked and acted nothing like him. It was particularly jarring after seeing Bryan Cranston nail the role in *All the Way*. But obviously he was not the focus of the film so it's a minor complaint, yet it is my biggest one.\n\nPortman nailed the role and the voice though. She's certainly improved significantly in terms of accents since *V For Vendetta*, that's for sure. So far she's my frontrunner for Best Actress, even though she probably won't actually win because all of Hollywood is wanking over *La La Land* right now.\n\nThe score was phenomenal and extremely unconventional in the best way possible. Felt it captured the mood perfectly. Set and costume designs were also great. It all added up to create a spot-on atmosphere.\n\nThe focus of the movie was not at all what I expected. I expected more standard biopic fare. This was, instead, more of a meditation on grief and a psychological profile of Jackie in the days following the assassination. This pleasantly surprised me and it gave the movie a focus and depth lacking in most traditional biopics. The movie is depressing as all hell because of it, but it worked for me anyway. A movie about this subject shouldn't be a joy to watch; like Jackie herself insisting that all see her blood-stained dress, it shows the raw and painful truth of the tragedy. It was neither overwrought or over-long. It was a film with a specific theme to convey, and I think it succeeded.\n\nSurprised to see it getting some hate here, but I can certainly understand why someone wouldn't *enjoy* the movie. Dismissing its strengths as a work of art, though, is just wrong as far as I'm concerned. It's also a good work of historical drama that should certainly be of interest to anyone with an interest in US presidential history, or the Kennedy administration/assassination particularly. If you don't possess such an interest, I can see how it wouldn't do much for you but it is still certainly a well-made film.\n\nBonus note: John Hurt's role as the priest just made the movie feel even more somber to me, knowing now this was his last role. (At least the last he was alive to see released; perhaps there are posthumous roles coming out I am unaware of, but still.)",

            "body": "So, I had a lot of thoughts about this film. I think it tried a lot of things but didn't have a clear conception of what it wanted to be, and because of that it suffered. Portman's Jackie is great and on point, though the accent work in some scenes could have used a bit more work; especially in the early interview segments it felt forced and took me out of it a bit.\n\n There are definitely moments that are resonant and powerful [Jackie explaining to her children that their father is dead, for example](#spoiler). However, I think that overall the film can't decide if it wants to be a film about a grieving mother or a film about Jackie Kennedy orchestrating the legacy of JFK. Furthermore, I really felt as though the inclusion of the assassination at the end of the film was unnecessary and took away from the film. We'd already seen everything surrounding the assassination, and it was heart wrenching to see Jackie's response to it by itself, and it felt as though it didn't need to be shown. When it was, it felt like it was more for shock value than anything else. \n\nLastly, I thought the score was overbearing. The heavy, dissonant track that played over and over was an interesting addition at first, but as it continues to be repeated it felt as though the movie was yelling at me to be sad. I felt as though the score didn't believe in the ability of the movie to be genuinely emotionally affecting, so it attempted to overcompensate by serving as emotional cues that ulitmately weren't necessary. That said, some people I saw the movie with liked the score a lot, so maybe that's just a me thing. Ultimately, I'd give this like a 3/5. Not an awful movie, just not one I particularly need to see again.\n\n",

If anything truly shines (besides Portman, of course), it's Mica Levi's chilled, honorable score, although even that fully runs out of steam by exploring its climatic rhythms before the first frame burns brightly on the screen, settling for shallow repetition and cyclical motifs instead. A missed opportunity precisely because its visceral outlook on grief should've been expanded upon rather than shown through scattered, constructed fragments, and to think such a topic could be fully covered via a boring, obvious framing device is even more of a head-scratcher. Not really recommended unless you appreciate a little \"hey, look at me, I'm art!\" in your typical biopic soup.",

However there were three aspects that made this worthwhile for me. The lead performance, Portman carries the film with strength and fragility. The cinematography which captures the aesthetic of the 60s that feels very familiar and very nostalgic.

Her body language was amazing and her range from broken and defeated to defiant is incredibly impressive. Even in her most broken moments she still plays it with an underlying sense of strength and resilience and in her most defiant moment she still has an underlying sadness. Great performance all around. She really carried the film, which isn't to say that the other parts of the film weren't great,  but so much of the film required her to be great to work. Larrain put a lot of trust in her to give it her all by relying on close ups so often throughout the film. \n\nLarrain also deserves a lot of praise for his direction. The constant use of close ups really allowed Portman to shine but also helped the audience connect with Jackie and feel the weight of the world on her shoulders. His direction, along with the cinematography, allow the film to visually portray the  weight of the situation and compliments all the performances very well. He takes a pretty good but not outstanding screenplay and turns it into something great. I also really enjoyed the mix of archival footage spliced in throughout the film. \n\nThe score also really adds to the films uneasy and eerie atmosphere. Mica Levi is definitely a composer to keep your eye on. \n\nThe editing in some parts was a little odd and not to my liking but not enough enough to really subtract from an otherwise great film. ",

            "body": "I respectfully disagree with a lot of this comment. I too thought that it was a little annoying to show the actual assassination at the end but when I thought about it a little later after watching the movie it made more sense. The movie itself bends a lot of cinematic tropes and cop outs. Like the first time, scenes were hinted at in movies, like starting and ending the movie with the same scene or someone being killed without actually seeing the death, it was amazing. yet over time those kinds of things became overused and expected. I think that with Jackie, they were smart to finally show the assassination at the end. A little bit because then we could see the things she was alluding to in the interview; Jack's face, his brains, her paralyzation on the way to the hospital, all of it. Additionally, I'm so thankful they didn't end the movie with the same scene that its started with, they continued the story a little bit, for that last reminder that the movie is, at least somewhat, about living with the President. However, I do agree that at sometimes the movie was confusing. Like it is important that they didn't leave out Camelot because that is what the family was known for, but it felt a little overused. I agree that at times the score was too heavy, but it felt very necessary to continue the somberness of it. I don't think the movie could have been as great with large scenes without noise, it didn't feel like it would be able to hold up well enough like that. The thing about Jackie that I love that portman achieved was the awkward shoulders and the duck feet. That was absolutely perfect. Though yes, all the legacy talk made me just as uncomfortable- like the director was telling the audience \"this is what you have to think when you think Jackie now!!\"",
