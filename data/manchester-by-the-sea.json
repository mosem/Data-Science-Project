            "body": "I saw it today and found it incredible. A few thoughts:\n\n* As a few have mentioned, the scene in the police station was heart-wrenching. Not just the attempted suicide, but Lee's testimony delivered as a confession and him ready to be punished for the death of his children. He wanted to be found as guilty as he felt and felt that it was wrong not to be punished for it.\n* The contrast in the lives of Lee and Patrick. Patrick comes off as so youthful and exuberant even in the shadow of his father's death, and Lee is simply a dead man walking. Neither person understands where the other is coming from, yet the familial bond exists (especially where one doesn't between Patrick and Joe's friend George).\n* Lee's resistance to Manchester is so strong and so insistent that you wonder why (especially for Patrick's sake) until he is alone with Randi. You see hints early on when he can't process that Randi is pregnant by another man, that life is restored but not through him. When Randi tells Lee \"I love you\", it cuts him so deep, like he didn't want to have heard that, that he didn't want to be forgiven in any sense for what happened.\n* Patrick treats Lee like a surrogate father almost right away, asking permission for this and that, and Lee pushes back by declaring that he does not care what Patrick thinks or does. But Lee does care when he tries to assert that no, Patrick can't have one of his two girlfriends over, finding his nephew's two-faced gaming to be too much.\n* The scene with Patrick and his mother and her new husband was so painful in the sense that we know almost right away it will not work out. The awkward moments that become even more awkward in being highlighted. The sense that Patrick could do whatever he wants but dwells in an atmosphere of control that the mother apparently needs to avoid sliding back. We further find this out in the new husband's email to Patrick where he asserts that he needs to control what the mother wants to do, apparently knowing what is best for her.\n* When Lee says he can't beat it, he means he can't ever get past his trauma and embrace the opportunity to be a parent again (especially when his drinking leads to a fire scare that could have endangered Patrick). He does feel responsibility to his brother but has to find a balance between taking care of his nephew and avoiding his demons.\n\nAs others have mentioned, despite the trauma carried through the movie, there are moments of humor -- the hand-cutting exchange being the most highlighted, plus the awkwardness of loading Randi into the ambulance, Lee asking Patrick if he's going to Godspell, etc. The ending didn't feel out of place for me since there is no nice bow to put on the whole story. Lee delivered the best solution he could conceive, and he didn't ask Patrick his preference, taking charge of the situation.\n\nI feel the above still isn't enough to capture the layers of the movie, that words do not suffice to write about the gaps between people and the stumbling that occurs throughout. It competes well with *Moonlight*, and I can't really decide on the better film, both being so different. (I've yet to see *La La Land* to compare with these two.)",

            "body": "For me, this movie is partially about what depression feels like. Lee is the personification of it. You don't like yourself. You sit around with your emotions bottled up, not really doing much, mumbling and avoiding eye contact, because apathy is better than what you would do if you let your emotions take over. You find yourself doing things that you know will ultimately set you back (represented by Lee purposely starting bar fights) just so you don't have to move forward. For whatever reason, you feel like you just *can't* progress. Almost like you know you shouldn't be able to. Like you don't deserve it. The way that most of the scenes are shot from a distance, with flat framing and angles and no camera movement - that's what it all feels like. Even when an opportunity presents itself for you to leave your shitty job and live in a nice house in a nice town, all expenses already paid, you're still resistant to leave your shitty one-room apartment. Is there any sense in that? No. But depression doesn't make sense. \n\nAnd then the ending symbolizes that there are times where it seems like you're so *close* to making something of yourself, to pulling it together, but... nope, nevermind. Turns out you just had a good week. When they paid for the boat, it seemed all good from there. At first I expected to movie to end on Lee going to the store, allowing Patrick to finally get laid. That's a cool fatherly thing to do, it puts a satisfying end to a running subplot for the secondary character, and Lee going back to the store (I think it was the same store he went to the night his house burned down but I could be wrong) could symbolize him finally getting over what happened that night, forgiving himself, and moving on. But then the movie keeps going. He puts Patrick in more capable hands and decides to move back to Boston. To paraphrase Lee, he just... can't. He can't do it. That's what trying to make progress with depression is like. And it fucking hurts. This movie was too real. ",

            "body": "Saw this a week ago. It's my second favorite film of the year after La La Land so far. Casey Affleck delivers one of the most believable portraits of a man haunted by his past I've ever seen. It's a nuanced, funny, and thoroughly real performance, making for a career-defining display from one of this generation's best actors. If you've seen the film, you'll know what scene I'm talking about when I say I was in awe at how quietly he displayed his grief as the emotions bottle up inside of him. And the moment that grief erupts is one of the few times I've gasped out loud during a film.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this movie is how, despite the heavy drama and tragedy, it's *very* funny at times. This is due to Ken Lonergan's understanding that life is neither a strict drama or comedy, therefore his screenplay isn't binary in this aspect. Some of my favorite scenes are the banal moments that just develop these characters so realistically through their interactions.\n\n\"What happened to your hand?\"\n\"I cut it.\"\n\"Oh, for a second there I didn't know what happened to your hand.\"\n\nAll of the actors give brilliant, understated performances and I never felt I was watching performers, especially Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges. Brilliant writing, brilliant direction, brilliant acting. This movie floored me. \n\nEdit: Realized this is a discussion thread so spoilers allowed. That scene where he tries to shoot himself.

First of all it is the only time Patrick shows an emotional reaction to his father's death, which makes sense because his family knew for years that he could die at any moment.  It goes to show that no matter how prepared you are to lose someone, it is still going to affect you in a difficult way.\n\nAlso, in the same scene in the kitchen, it is interesting to see how lee is able to help his nephew calm down but he is unable to help him on any real emotional level because he himself is so numb he simply can't empathize.  But he truly wants to, he even goes so far to break open the bedroom door so the kid wasn't in there suffering alone.  Once he is in there he again can't comfort him but he does help the situation by being there.  Shows that lee really is a good guy.  Most interesting is the fact that lee in Boston is basically a guilt-wridden depressed human being who lives in that miserable little apartment where he must beat himself up constantly night after night.  He is walled up emotionally, walled up socially, walled up in real life.  But the second his nephew tries to do the same to himself, Lee breaks that door (barrier) down, and helps him. Just something no one has figured out how to do with lee, including himself.",

Casey's character had a lot of bad luck and wasn't the best dude but pretty much everyone in his life still cared about him in some way. None of the characters here are one-dimensional or antagonistic, even his ex-wife is kind of sweet and caring.\n\nThere will be a lot of talk about the scene in the police station, or the house burning, or the main scene near the end with his Williams, but the scene that got me the most was Casey and Hedges at the dinner table where Casey just says \"I just can't beat it\". That one scene is as accurate and honest a portrayal of grief, depression, and loneliness as I've seen put to film.\n\nAlso, did everyone else catch Lonergan's little cameo?

            "body": "I have seen this movie now seven times. I have come to the conclusion that it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. \n\nKenneth Lonergan is the most gifted writer alive next to Annie Baker. A few points:\n\n1. Those who find the movie melodramatic, I respect your opinion, but I also feel you might not be paying attention. The melodramatic sequence in this movie (the fire and S.A.) specifically exists as a flashback. The movie is not about the melodramatic event of someone's life, and we very specifically do not see the central marriage disintegrate. It's about what happens after the opera curtain comes down. Stories have a natural progression of ending in tragedy or using tragedy as their central focal point, but this is about dealing with the pain of the old memory after you've already made a new one. I think the movie as a whole would be almost as powerful as it is now if they removed the flashback sequence (though it does jerk the tears), and I wish that Lonergan didn't include it, not because he doesn't handle it effectively, but because I think it causes a lot of people to misinterpret the film (not saying that I'm somehow more perceptive, but I have a lot of experience with Kenneth Lonergan, having seen and read a ton of his work, and this is a fairly common thread in some of his plays.)\n\n2. The way that Lonergan approaches clich\u00e9 situations and manages to subvert them, not with any kind of spectacular plotting but with merely his ear for the way people talk, is kind of amazing. He reveals the truth in clich\u00e9s. A lot of his plays cover this same topic as well (and are of equal quality to this movie)\n\n3. Lucas Hedges is amazing in this movie, and basically gives the masculine counterpoint to Anna Paquin's performance in Margaret. If anyone actually cares, I could go into more detail here.\n\n4. If you like this move, check out Margaret (extended cut), which is from the same writer/director and is possibly my favorite movie of all time.",

Once he goes back inside you see him and Randi talking and laughing for a brief moment.

It almost feels as if the direction is a fly on the wall style. It feels like your peering into these peoples lives and it works. Extremely well.\n\nCasey Affleck gives one of the most subdued performances I've ever seen. I know this is cliche, but this movie feels real. Very real.\n\nOne of the best parts is watching Lucas Hedges. We're here watching a teenager, that I for one, completely understood. He was very much a good kid that kept fucking things up. He has a band, and he knows they suck. He has two girlfriends, and two sets of friends to go along with them. He tries, but mostly succeeds at little to nothing in this film. \n\n\n10/10\n\n\n\n\n",

Besides, if you're here and haven't seen the film yet you're probably aware that you've put yourself at risk for seeing spoilers. Nevertheless, SPOILERS ahead....:\n\n\nI wonder if Lonergan ever thought of including flashback scenes of media coverage of the tragic house fire. This type of terrible situation is someone like Nancy Grace's wet dream (my thoughts on how Nancy covered tragic stories on her show is a different story). I feel like in the days/weeks/months following there would be extensive coverage of the events. It can be assumed that Lee was ultimately exonerated of any wrong doing in the death of his three children, correct? If that was truly the case, even if it didn't occur in a social media era, it definitely did occur in an era where stories like these would dominate TV/radio news programs, daytime talk shows, newspapers, etc etc. A young father of three children holds party at his house with his buddies until 2-3am in the morning, where cannabis, cocaine, and lots of alcohol was consumed. When the party is ended by his wife, the father sets the fireplace to warm the house and then decides to go to a nearby corner store. Intoxicated and not wanting to drive, the father decides to walk even though it's an altogether 40 minute trip by foot. 10 minutes into his trek, he can't remember if he put the fireplace screen up but figures it will be okay and decides to continue walking to the store. When he returns, he is greeted by the scene of his young wife resisting fire fighters and screaming that her kids are still in the house, which is now completely ablaze. His wife survives, but his three kids (one of them only a couple years old if that) do not. \n\nThe father admits to authorities that he wasn't sure whether he put the screen up or not before leaving to go to the store. He also openly admits of the substance abuse that went on earlier that night.\n\nIt's obvious that Lee was blamed by a lot of people in the community for the fire, including his (eventual ex) wife. But I would wager the story reached beyond just his community. If he was in fact fully exonerated of any responsibility in the death of his three children, I would wager that the story went national for at least awhile. We can all imagine the amount of guilt Lee feels about his kids fate even without the public and media scrutiny. But I can't imagine the amount of stress, anxiety, and overall darkness the man went through if he had to deal with this tragedy in the public eye.\n\nI don't know, this thought just made Lee's story even more powerful and sad.

The guttural wailing from Michelle Williams as she's pulled away from the house was eerily real.] (#spoiler) \n\nThere were a number of completely silent moments in this movie that seemed to last a while, creating a bit of an awkward noiseless lull for everyone in the theater. \n\nNice film.",

            "body": "I saw this film last night in Boston. I moved to Boston from the west coast 5 years ago, and this film really captures a certain New England thing; where acceptance, not idealism, rule. Lee Chandler is a terribly damaged version of that, but it ring so true of others in the film.  There's the great recurring theme of frozen ground. The boy complains about it and is quite upset. Lee doesn't do much to help the kid understand or work through it. He just repeats 'ground is frozen'. Accept it, don't complain. Don't expect anyone to sugar it up for you. I liked the movie last night and am beginning to love it. It won't leave you for a while. As others note it's not fast-paced, but it is dense with suggestions of emotions, little clues to understanding. It feels like watching a leaf fall very slowly down from a tree in early winter. Makes you feel that way. ",

One was when Affleck was speaking to his ex-wife about Hedges's character being okay because \"he doesn't really open up to me, but he has a lot of friends, so I think he's okay.\" Which was true, Hedges really leaned on his friends to maintain a sense of normalcy during his bereavement, and they were constant throughout the film. \n\nThen consider the scene where Affleck steps into the office if his former employer (I think?) to ask for shifts, and the guy's wife comes around the corner and tells him she doesn't want to see Affleck again. Affleck's character had no support from anyone but his brother. The rest of the town really seemed to turn on him. They left him to mourn alone.\n\nIt all sort of culminates for me when they're playing ball at the end of the film. Affleck tells him to let it go, and Hedges refuses. Two very different responses to tragedy, with two very different sets of support structures surrounding them. ",

Although, frankly, the second viewing didn't make me love the movie that much more than I already did. \n\nAnd I think that was due to the score, and how intrusive I felt it to be, especially in the first half. There were so many scenes I just wish were silent. I thought the music kinda didn't allow me to breathe and absorb the scene as much as I wanted. Eg.: [When Lee and Joe were at Lee's burned-down home and Lee's sees one of his kids being removed in a bodybag. I feel toned down music or even silence would've helped the scene better.](#spoiler) I do remember reading that Lonergan was purposeful with this as he wanted the music the be representative of what Lee no longer felt and had in his life. While this does help provide some perspective, I still personally feel some scenes would've been aided more by something more complimentary.\n\nSmall thing I noticed: [in the bit where Patty is reading the e-mail from his mom's fianc\u00e9, there's another e-mail of Sylvia asking him to prom. Totally a small thing, but says something about the Patty-Sylvia relationship given that she asked him out through e-mail.](#spoiler)\n\nAnother thing I really, really loved in the opening and closing scenes. [The similarities are obvious: the Chandlers are fishing together on their boat. It's worthwhile to notice what is missing now in the final scene. One, the father, and two, that long white vertical pole railing thing at the back of the boat (which I presume was some sort of protective railing so kid Patty doesn't fall overboard). It's an interesting set design element that invites us to remember what was lost and what it used to mean to both Patty and Lee.](#spoiler)\n\nOne thing I didn't get: [there's this one scene where Sandy and Patty are walking into a house, and she mentions that she knows about his second girlfriend. Yet the next scene is them in bed after having sex. Why? How was she cool about her boyfriend cheating about her? Of course, this isn't a big thing, but I'm still left a little wondering haha.](#spoiler)",

The landscape shots, although being way too many, were just gorgeous to look at and maybe it has to do with me not having that sort of scenery where I'm from, but I have to say that it merits a rewatch just for that. \n\nThe movie is a masterclass in acting, if I may say so. Both Casey Affleck and the actor who played Patrick (can't remember his id) were great. I felt like the director was aware that without magnificent performances, the movie would fail miserably. \n\nThere were moments in which the camera lingered on people, which felt sort of awkward as we as an audience are not use to this gaps, but they also allowed the actors to show the full lenghts of the emotions they were portraying. \n\nIn a way,I think it is an excellent movie that needs to be digested correctly and watched with a critical mind in order to fully appreciate.

His ability to maneuver the constant tonal shifts between heavy grief and comic banality remains on point, and he really pushes it to some new extremes with this one.  What Lonergan does can best be described as an attempt to capture the feeling of \"sonder\" through cinema.  He puts his protagonists in the background of scenes essentially starring side characters, has them drop in late and leave early, so their stories play out in a fully realized world, like a series of candid moments casually observed by a random passerby (Lonergan himself has a cameo in one such role).  His directing is amazingly low-key and never calls attention to itself, though every single shot is thoughtfully placed and cut.  He makes it look easy.",

There were even a bunch of random B-roll shots that they occasionally cut to for no reason.\n\nIt just felt kinda forced, honestly.  It felt like they were trying to make the most artful film they could -- with all the long pauses and all the people talking over each other.  But there were times when I couldn't hear what people said and it was just 'yelling.'\n\nThe tone really bothered me -- so relentlessly heavy yet they've got bizarre scenes like the one with Patrick and the doll house.  I get the need for comic relief in a heavy film, but a lot of times it fell flat.\n\nI didn't much like how Lee's character didn't really have an arc.  Beginning of the movie, we see him break out in a bar brawl.  End of the movie, same thing.  \n\nMatthew Broderick was so outrageously miscast.  Several people in the theater broke out laughing.\n\nTowards the end, things really started to feel like they were being wrapped up -- lot of scenes just happening and not leading to one another -- just events happening in sequence.\n\nI don't know why it's receiving such accolades.

            "body": "Commenting here as IMDB message board closed down. The movie was very boring, slow and very uplifting. \n\nAs a resident, Greater Boston, Quincy and North Shore I find to be a very cold place. Personally, on a drive or walk to Gloucester/Cape Ann area (where Manchester by the Sea is) to the art galleries or deep sea fishing, I'd probably never taken a second look at someone like Lee and write him off as just a Masshole Townie; (for anyone outside of Mass who is shocked at my prejudice/elitism, simply refer to the beginning scene between the black female tenant and Lee in Quincy, even when there is empathy/understanding, there is a great chasm in town vs. gown relations and racial & class relations underneath the superficial liberal political leanings of New England). \n\nThe movie didn't change my mind on Masshole townies nor increase my empathy for people like Lee. But it did change how I see love - or rather make allowance that I'd never be able to love someone, friend, relations or a partner in the Hollywood/Kodak framed moment kind of way; but will make do with imperfect gestures that will ultimately fall short, perhaps never be completely appreciated nor understood by my intended recipient and whatever heartfelt/self-serving content said completely forgotten later on; but the feelings felt in that moment between the participants will live on. \n\nIt turns out that the people who have blocked their true selves and communications were Matthew Broderick and Lee's nephew's mother who concerned themselves with living the \"pious\" and \"reformed religious\" life that they had nothing to say except the rigid Hollywood/Kodak image they wished to preserve of themselves by withholding their vulnerabilities. \n\nI actually thought Michelle William's emotional scene was not as powerful as the restrained love expressed by Lee and his family; fishing, buying furniture, just driving the nephew in the car. Even Dr.Bethany's words explaining \"cardiomyal weakness,\" her empathy - down to the awkward elevator scene of the new male attending doctor who didn't have the same history with Lee's family but his attempt to show basic human decency to Lee by not even speaking. \n\nWe plot out so many things to be perfect. Like our ideal vision of high school prom, college graduation, weddings when most of us plod along like being in an amateur awkward high school band concerned with critiquing our accompanying rushing or dragging drummer when we can't even manage the timing of strumming simple chords ourselves on the guitar either. Instead we have to rely on the graciousness of others to tolerate our first clumsy attempt, and help by pulling down their pants for us and get carried on with it. \n\nCarrying on with it is my interpretation. In a restrained relationship, we don't necessarily have to have reached an epiphany to call or rekindle the friendship. It will still be awkward, things will feel brief and negative feelings, unresolved stuff will bubble up; and any detente, reproachment may still fall short or could end abruptly. But moments are what we have and are too brief/precious for us to hide ourselves in and not take the opportunity to make asses out of ourselves. ",

I'd never thought of him as a superb actor but this film definitely makes his case.  \n\nMichelle Williams probably handed in the best performance, despite such little screen time. \n\nCJ Wilson and his brown jackets add that dash of New England authenticity to every scene he is in.  I feel like he was the *salt* of this film. \n\nI thought the interview/police station scene after the fire was very much on point, you could see the guilt and shame being shoveled onto Lee's shoulders. \n\nMy qualms --\n\nThe Patrick character came off as a bit disingenuous.  The character seemed a little too jaded/wise/adult for a semi-bereft 16 year old.  I feel like a good percentage of his dialogue was a pandering to the adult audience.  Don't get me wrong I really liked the character, it certainly added the needed brevity to a film with such a grey setting and subject matter, but I didn't buy the character as being authentic. \n\nThe pacing was slow, even for a film of this genre. \n\nMatthew Broderick's character was a bit obtuse.  His performance was good, but the lunch scene took the film off track for a few minutes.  \n\nCould have left both of the Tate Donovan scenes out entirely and the film wouldn't change a bit. \n\nStill trying to figure out the reasoning/purpose of Lee's random acts of violence. \n\nI am usually a big fan of open ended endings, but this one was a little too abrupt for my taste (just my opinion) - I could have used a just a little more closure.

It was heart wrenching to watch. Casey Affleck's performance was so haunting and felt so genuine that as of right now he's my top pick for Best Actor this year. Maybe I need a second viewing or it needs to sit with me a bit longer, but I didn't find Michelle Williams' performance to be super spectacular. It was a great job she did for sure and I enjoyed her in the role, but I just don't feel like it seems a lot of others do in that it was \"groundbreaking\" or \"her best work ever\". Idk. Also, I felt like the most moving/entertaining parts of the film are all in the flashback scenes. As I was watching it seemed like my cinematic brain turned bright during flashback scenes and then kind of leveled back down or \"turned dim\" during the present-day scenes. Which kind of makes me think some of the film's pacing could have been improved. With that said though, I can't say definitively that I truly believe either of these critiques to be true (Williams' performance being less than spectacular and the pacing being off). I need a second viewing to be able to finalize my opinions on both of these aspects. Overall, I give Manchester by the Sea an 8/10 and I think it's one of the best films of the year. Terrific screenplay, beautiful cinematography, top-notch acting. Worth a trip to the big screen to see it!\n\nI still haven't figured out what to make of Matthew Broderick's role in the film. The whole theater all kind of laughed when he appeared on screen. Y'all think he was the right choice or no? What'd you think of how he was used in the movie?",

I liked You Can Count On Me, didn't like Margaret, and I just think that I don't care for Lonergan's style.\n\nI don't know if maybe it's supposed to feel that way, but the one word that came to my mind for most of the movie (until the last third) was \"lethargic\", felt dead to me, flaccid, very real in a way, and maybe unnerving for that reason.\n\nThe very simple look and direction of the film don't help, it just doesn't feel cinematic to me (don't downvote :D ).\n\nWhen the fire scene happens, I expected it a lot from it after reading it on the page, and onscreen, it just felt to me absolutely mundane, the music in that scene was so wrong and obnoxious, I read some comments on Twitter by some guy saying the final cut of the movie was \"ruined\" by the score, implying that there was some added music compared to the Sundance cut and that might be it.\n\nThat scene should feel emotional as hell, more dramatic (well, the movie avoids that at all costs, I get it), more cinematic, I was so disappointed by that.\n\nIt just lacks life, I felt like there was no life to it....... until that last third and especially that heartbreaking scene between Lee & Randi, it's funny because it's the first scene where Lee shows something for the first time really, and coincidentally, that's where I felt something. So, I don't know, maybe the movie is supposed to feel that way? But I quite like the last third.\n\nAffleck is of course excellent, he's the frontrunner for the Oscar, sweeping every award ceremony but I have to admit that the restraint of the film, of not being this overblown dramatic thing like many movies are, worked on the page for me but ultimately the execution did not until that last third, and when Affleck gets to finally show his emotions, that's when he soars. \n\nHedges excellent too, very funny.\n\n",

            "body": "Holy crap, this was so bleak. One theme seemed to be, \"some people just shouldn't be parents.\" Which is...sort of compelling, I guess.\n\nTechnically, my main issue was the soundtrack. During the most emotional scene (and throughout the movie) the organ music took me out of the moment. \n\nAdditionally, I think a better movie would have \"implied\" more than literally showing the dead children's body bags. I think showing the house in fire, Michelle getting held back by firemen, then cut to the confession at the police dept, with maybe a lightning fast flashback of the fire again would have been more subtle.\n\nI did like Michelle Williams and the actor who played Patrick, as well as the narrative structure with selective flashbacks. Casey affleck was good and will deserve his inevitable Oscar nomination.\n\nIt was a fine movie, but I don't get why it's leading awards noms and at the top of critics' lists. I can handle a little bleak, but this was too much to the point where you wonder what the point of all the suffering is.",

I thought it was a fantastic film with amazing performances by all the main leads (wish there was more Kyle Chandler, but I understand why there wasn't) - the kid playing Patrick was especially impressive. \n\nI did have one question - there was a moment when Lee was driving to Beverly right after he got the call about Joe where it cuts to him in a short-sleeved yellow shirt looking over the sea (I'm assuming at Manchester). At first, I thought he had stopped for a second but it didn't make sense (different shirt and why would he be stopping when the matter at hand was so urgent). I think at this point, we hadn't had too many (if any?) flashback scenes, so it only dawned upon me later that it wasn't in the same sequential timing as the driving scene.\n\nWas this meant to be a flashback or flashforward? What was the purpose? In a movie that had so much meaning and thought with every scene and how it was framed, this one left me a little puzzled. Can anyone shed some light here?",

The performances are great, but the direction and the editing hurt the film for me. The editing actually gets in the way of the film, while the direction merely does nothing to improve the film.\n\n\nThe editing is totally uneven. At times, the camera sits staring at characters as awkward moments pass or they wait for someone to return. At other times, scenes end mid-conversation, cutting away for no discernible reason and leaving out information.\n\nThe direction is uninspired, as far as I could tell. Nothing about it surprised me or made me appreciate it. A lot of the scenes have really boring direction, using one or two camera angles and just switching back and forth. Also, an utterly out of place slow-motion scene at a funeral that went on... and on... and on.\n\nFinally, the music was way over the top. During tragic moments, the classical music soundtrack blared for minutes at a time. The filmmakers should have been confident enough in their work to let it stand without such heavy music.\n\nI know this post is mostly negative, but these are the things I'm interested in hearing responses to.

I've seen this sort of heartbreak and emotional destruction in my own family and seeing these emotions play out on screen was really hard to watch. But they handled it beautifully. Affleck put on an outstanding performance and everyone carried their weight and delivered outstanding work. I thought some of the pacing was off but the message and writing was stellar. I haven't seen any previous Lonergan films so I'll definitely check-out his work now. I'm thankful they didn't fall into any easy answers, but instead allowed the characters to follow natural arcs and grow and change the way they needed to. Definitely a movie you have to see with the expectation that it's a slow, slow film, but is an exploration that we should all allow ourselves to take. Looking forward to award season to see if Affleck gets the recognition he deserves. \n\nAlso, even though Kyle Chandler's scenes were limited, he absolutely crushed it. All the performances during the police department scene absolutely floored me. ",

The sporadic way the boy grieved over his father didn't seem real to me. If he was so 'resilient' he could still go about trying to have sex with that one girl, why didn't he 'use' grief over his father's death as a sympathy play? This whole storyline seemed really unfocused to me and not completely thought out.\n\nFor all the issues I had with the film though, I appreciate what is was NOT. Most films like this are about people overcoming obstacles, while a few are tragedies where people completely fail. This is like something inbetween, a guy who fails to resolve his problem, yet makes an effort to meet the problem halfway - so it is neither a sad nor a happy ending.",

My opinion will be in the bottom 1% of what this sub thinks of it.\n\nAs a longtime fan of Casey Affleck, and a starving film lover who has seen precisely 1 truly great movie in the last 2 years (Mad Max: Fury Road, before that I would say Birdman and Whiplash), I made the trip across the Hudson to see Manchester by the Sea after a 99% Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n\n2 1/2 hours later, I felt the same exact way as Casey Affleck coming home to see his house burned down with all his children in it.\nI don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna talk about it. I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta go.\n\nIt's the kind of movie I hate the most - a film where not very much happens, and that's supposed to be \"edgy\" and \"cool\" and all of the film elitists will swoon and call it \"brilliant\" because they think they can see something we all don't.\nI've seen this phenomenon with Boyhood, The Master, Inside Llewynn Davis, Synecdoche NY, Enemy and There Will Be Blood.\nIt's considered \"gritty\" or \"realistic\" to have a film where not much happens. Let the audience fill in the blanks.\n\nCasey Affleck experiences the most horrifying event anyone can imagine, and we have 2 1/2 hours of him saying or doing nothing, and responding with \"I don't wanna talk about it\" or \"I gotta go\" to every possible conversation or conflict. There is no real dramatic scene. No true revelations.\n\nHe never changes from beginning to end. And the film drags you along the way.\n\nI'm sure the screenwriter thought a big, dramatic awakening scene would be too \"unrealistic\".\n\nWhen the final, anticlimatic \"fuck you, audience\" scene occurred, I literally shook my head in disgust and said \"oh come on\" out loud.\n\nI'm reminded of the great Adaptation by Charlie Kaufman. When Nic Cage goes to the screenwriter and says \"I want to make a film where nothing much happens, much like in the real world.\" And the guy says (paraphrasing) \"The real world? The real fucking world? Things happen everyday. Every fuckin' day, a mother gets beaten to death in front of her son on the steps of a church, someone goes hungry, a man betrays his best friend for a woman. If you can't find that stuff in life, then you, my friend don't know crap about life!\"\nManchester By The Sea is flat-out boring. It's 2 1/2 hours of waiting for something to happen that never happens.\n\nBring back real movies.",

For that reason, although it ties with La La Land and Moonlight as the best films of the year for me, it won't be the first one that I recommend to other people.\n\nI honestly don't understand why I put myself through this twice really. Each time I really sobbed through the tragic fire/police station sequence, and I mean both times, even when I knew what was coming the second time. The last time that I cried this badly was last year's Room. And the last time that I still cried after fully knowing what's gonna happen was, well it has never happened. Suffice to say that, with all the editing problem this movie has, that sequence was just incredible combining with its score and all the cutting between past and present.\n\nAlso, at about 2 hours and 15 minutes long, this film is actually a very easy sit. I think this is mostly because of Lonergan's incredible script which mix the main tragedy with humor all over the film. Because of this, the whole film is very real and relatable.

It was overwrought and unrealistic as written and scored.

Certainly the performances were outstanding, and I thought it was very well written. I really thought Lonergan struck a great balance between drama and comedy. This movie could've easily become a melodrama, but the comedy and the subtle performances resisted that territory, which I thought was a great creative choice.\n\nHowever, I didn't really feel like it ventured into any new territory. Other than the scenic shots (which were admittedly beautiful), it didn't really feel very visually daring. If someone could offer me any insight on this that I'm missing, I'd love to hear it. \n\nIn terms of plot, it was compelling and well structured, but not exactly innovative. There have been many movies about grief over the years, and nothing about this one separated itself from those in my eyes. It was well executed, so I guess it'd be amongst the better of these types of films, but I guess it just didn't hit me quite as deeply as I wanted it to.\n\nAnyway, like I said, I don't mean to sound like I dislike the film.

            "body": "I'm from Manchester. The original. The UK Manchester. Some would say the *real* Manchester. Its famous for being grey and rainy - and not near Essex. Nor by the sea. But, despite the weather, we make the best of it. I love this city. It is vibrant, youthful, energetic and positive. \n\nIt is everything this film isn't. \n\nMbtS was an over-long 2.5 hour TV-movie melodrama - but without any dazzling, shouty ad breaks every 15 minutes to inject a bit of life back into the viewer.\n\nI was bored silly. \n\nWhen I go to see a film I want to feel something (other than boredom). I don't care if that's sadness, revulsion, fear, elation, etc - I just want to feel. Yes, the disconnected numbness felt when viewing MbtS could be analogous to Casey Affleck's withdrawn character, but, I'm sorry, that doesn't translate to an arresting cinema going experience.\n\nIt comes to something when the most memorable character was the girl overheard telling her friend how she wanted to fuck Affleck as he unclogged her toilet. Unfortunately she was only in MbtS for 30 seconds. Everyone else, without exception, was bland, lifeless and tedious. \n\n*\"Tedious\"*.\n\nThat's the perfect word to describe this film. \n\nWhen a character movie has such dreary characters, the film fails. I couldn't engage with anyone. They're all so lazily written, monotonously acted and badly realised. \n\nLet's get one thing straight; a lack of emotion does not display Oscar-worthy range. It is not subtlety. It is not grounded. It is *not* to be applauded. A snotty, whiny apology with sadface is not good acting. Punching undeserving people in bars is not powerful drama. Driving an entitled teenager around a miserable town in a dull red truck is not entertainment. \n\nThe lead is Affleck. He can't seem to keep away from tragedy, but he tries by avoiding conversation and drowning his sorrows in drink. A nuanced and original character he is not. \n\nThe other main character is the orphaned teenage boy. Again, someone with very little emotional range. Other than the odd, unfunny wisecrack - despite a recently deceased father. Above I called him *entitled*. I fear I may be overselling him. He isn't interesting enough to earn the description. \n\nI saw this film only a few hours ago, but the only other characters I can recall are the brother that dies, a wife that used to drink, a [few charred kids in a bodybag](#spoiler), fat Ferris Bueller and... that's it. Everyone else is forgettable window-dressing. They are there to drag out the almost non-existent plot. \n\nAh, the 'plot'. Well, boring Afflek has to look after a boring 16 year old kid after his boring brother (the kid's father) dies. That's it. For 2 and a half hours. \n\nCome. Follow them on their wacky adventures!\n\nOr not.  \n\nI'm afraid Depressing Afflek's character lost me the moment he started the first bar fight. Yes, 'first', as in there are more. \n\nHe also fights a window. And loses.  \n\nNormal people don't punch strangers for looking at them in a bar. That's psychotic behavior. That will get you arrested, no matter what your past tragedies. But in miserable-movie-world that's just a physical metaphor for his emotional plight. Sigh. \n\nFrom that point on I didn't care about him, his dull family, or their lazy dramas. \n\nAnd yes, [its all your fault your kids are dead](#spoiler) is about the laziest trope to give your character a tragic past.\n\nI think the thing that truly killed it was just how easy everyone had it. There were no stakes. They were all devoid of struggle. No one had any real-world problems - beyond the dead family members. [The worm-food dad left the kid a huge paid-off house, a boat, and lots of cash to help Misery Afflek look after him, FFS.](#spoiler) \n\n[Their worst quandary was deciding what to do with the inherited boat. You see, it had an engine that really needed replacing, but the cash wasn't immediately available. Until it was. When they found the dad's presumably antique guns to sell.](#spoiler)\n\n[I say found. They were in a moodily lit display cabinet in the house all along.](#spoiler) \n\n\"But what about all the dead people.\" I hear the menopausal MbtS fans shreik. You know, dying family members come up, but it doesn't seem to be all that relevant to the plot. No one seems all that affected by the deaths. They mourn in their own, boring, guarded ways - but so what? If they had to deal with that on top of financial troubles, or a criminal past, *or anything* then that could have been interesting, but 'interesting' was notably absent from MbtS. \n\n[I think the interview after the fire scene summed it up perfectly. Moaning Afflek is surprised that he can go free, despite killing three kids in an accident. That's it. A little suicidal emotional outburst is end-scene. Done. No need to revisit.](#spoiler) \n\n[Couldn't there have been maybe some suspicion of arson? Maybe the investigation was ongoing when he was forced to return to Manchester? Maybe the emotional weight of having to deal with dead children on top of the town's suspicious eyes would have given this film a layer of depth it cried out for?](#spoiler) \n\n[But no. That would have been skirting too close to the fires of plot. We've had enough of fire, thank you very much.](#spoiler) So back to the grey, uneventful, bleak dullness of it all. \n\nHere's the thing; if I don't care about the characters, I don't care about their apparent hidden anguish in a plot-less film. When a disconnect like the first groansome bar fight, or Ferris Bueller's Day Off The Diet, rips you out of the movie - why care what's going through these character's minds? They become just that - characters. Actors playing make believe. The film fails when all I see is pretense through the mucus. \n\nI could go on, but - unlike this movie - I know when to stop. \n\nEdited to fix broken spoiler tags. ",

But remember, the fire *was* a result of Lee's negligence, and he just might not be fit to be that kind of figure.  The important part is that he contends with this and finds out on his own.  You get the sense that this is the first time Lee actually gets to know himself in the context of other people since the fire, and by the end he comes to understand what he's capable of and what he's not.

The way the movie captures that feeling of severe distance and total emotional withdrawal after a tragedy is so razor sharp and I haven't experienced a more emotionally relatable and piercing moving this year (IMO).

They shape and define who we are. Just because we don't have something as sad as this happen to us doesn't mean we aren't restricted and impacted by our experiences and incapacity to process and learn and move on. And so despite no cathartic release and then a new direction and happy ending sometime later, the glimmer was enough, given that there is humor throughout and this is life for some (many/all) people.\n\nTo get spiritual, it's up to him to figure out the meaning of those events, and his connection to his family going forward. At all times we have a choice to be more open and loving, or to cower and protect ourselves (and sometimes protection is the best coping strategy we have at that moment). Depending on our religion, perhaps it was all meant to happen that way; perhaps this is his lesson if he can find the will to learn what he needs to to end his suffering (for example Randi is moving on, even though her heart wrt the daughters and their marriage is broken). To quote Rumi:  \u201cYou have to keep breaking your heart until it opens.\u201d \n\nThanks for your input on realism too...thoroughly agree. \n\nedit: spelling",

There's no explicit POV in the flashbacks, but they're definitely from an intimate perspective, so much that I'd say you can consider the whole back story part of Lee's memory. All of the flashbacks involve him and his interactions, his fuck ups, and reflect his regrets. I doubt it was even considered to tell it through the objective lens of the media.\n\nPlus, who's to say there wasn't a media frenzy and litigation off camera? There most likely was, but it was just not interesting enough. After all, his ex-wife apologizes for saying things to him for which she deserves \"to go to hell\", but we don't know what those things are. There's a lot untold about this story for a good reason.\n\nThis movie reminded me a lot of In the Bedroom, which actually involved some of the legal procedural effects of death, but didn't really care what anybody who wasn't involved would hear about the case. What you're suggesting would have turned the film into Gone Girl. Which I loved, but for different reasons.",

Notice girlfriend1 wanting to draw out his emotions and protect him, yet not much comes out. Same with coach offering \"someone to spill your guts to\", but many boys/men aren't taught how to process emotion, and it doesn't come as naturally to us compared to women.\n\nHe's learnt emotional processing (consciously and unconsciously) from his father, particularly in the absence of an alcoholic mother. \n\nThe scene in the freezer is a rare glimpse when some of the stored and blocked emotion rises to the surface. His pain in the chest and other physical symptoms are the unprocessed emotions under the surface, ready to be processed if he can hold the space. Unfortunately Lee can't hold that space either...in fact he is a well of unprocessed emotion triggering Randi every times she's near him. Yes she has her own feelings, but I expect given they were married there is a large amount of surrogation of emotion between them, and because he can't process his, she finds herself almost unable to control grief and other emotions in his presence.\n\nedit:  For example, here's a [story from Conspiracy, (great film btw)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZMuOhuB3Wo) - the interpretation could be different though. What if he didn't have any space and emotional safety to feel grief for the mother because of all that hate...but when the object of hate disappears, the heart can open and unresolved emotions that were blocked by having and being the hate surface.",

Some people deal with it better like Patrick who maybe just has too many things going on in his life that he simply doesn't have time to dwell on his loss. Plus the fact that it was expected makes it a little easier. Some people run from it like Randi who presumably immediately jumped into a relationship and started a new family to pave over the memories of the old one. Then there's people like Lee who, from his perspective, had everything and it was taken literally over night. He never made an effort to actually try and move on or make new connections. He's been stuck in a kind of limbo ever since.\n\nI think the scene with the bouncing ball at the end is very telling of how both characters attack their grief. Lee makes an attempt at play, but found when he had to put in effort to get the ball he'd rather abandon it. Patrick on the other hand ran after the ball multiple times to keep it in play. He understands the power of distraction and keeping busy. It isn't Lee that will help Patrick cope, but the other way around. Patrick is full of life and I think by the end Lee realizes that he could learn from that and that's why he makes arrangements to be able to see Patrick later on.\n",

Cause it just ends.  But then I thought about it, and what it is supposed to depict is real life and how real situations go down in the end.  Movie tropes have taught us that in this type of melodramatic family drama there is going to be either a big happy ending or a big sad ending. Real life isn't that way it's kind of somewhere in between and it doesn't end w/a curtain call or a movie ending, it just kind of meanders along. Like in MBTS.\n\nSo, WRT this specific ending, while we would expect Lee to grow and change and be all touchy-feely and be a proper guardian, in real life it just ain't that way, in such a DEFINED linear way. This particular soul was too damaged a person at that point in time to be a full-time parent.  And he knew it and he wanted the boy to have the best possible life so he made sure that he was taken care of with a close, loving family friend. All the while, making plans for the future ie getting a 1 bedroom apartment instead of the crappy studio he had; that's HUGE - this is subtle growth because heretofore he'd been living an extremely solitary life with zero room in any way for even one more person.  While he knew that he could not be full-time he made future plans to be a part-time guardian, the best that he could do because he was still extremely ill-equipped himself. His maturity was that he recognized this - he knew that he wasn't ready yet and that his nephew needed a more stable home - yet still made sure that he would continue his loving relationship with his nephew as best as he possibly could with perhaps hope for future living arrangements to change.\n\nHe goes out on the boat with his nephew: a repeat of the loving fun pasttime they used to do together in happier times. There is, for the first time in the present day scenes, a slight smile on Lee's face and definite contentment in this beloved hobby that they did together, as when they were closer years ago. This is a sign that Lee has started on the road to joy again, little bursts of joy. He is FINALLY on the road to BABY STEPS of recovery. \n\nSo although it's a very subtle growth and we need to examine it - it is growth, there was a huge arc there from solitary recluse, to someone who sees a light at the end of the tunnel and will maintain this healthy, necessary relationship in the future in the best way he knows how. \n\nRemember he was suicidal at one point so this was a huge healing step for him.\n\nReal life; this was a life changing movie, not to be missed.",

He just \"walks around waiting to die\".  Although it can be seen as inaction I think there is a tremendous depth to his character, and the little nuances to his actions and reactions are what truly let me know that Casey Affleck isn't asleep at the wheel but fully absorbed in the character.",

He also makes a compromise of quitting his job in Boston to be nearer to his nephew and making room for him in his new apartment to show him he is still 'there' for him as much as he can be (making him different to the mother who cannot even go that far for her son).\n\n",

It's a plot device that also serves development into Patrick's character. ",

I also had people laugh at the casting of Broderick, but at the same time you could tell immediately he wasn't meant to be a funny character. \n\nI don't think Lee was supposed to have an \"arc\" per se. He was just a broken man trying to continue life knowing that he could never undo the mistakes he made. In fact, if his character did start to get better, I think it would have done the film a disservice. A great example being his awkward conversation with the mother who had a thing for him. He knew it was never going to go anywhere and she found out pretty quickly as well. No need to create an unnecessary relationship to show him overcoming anything.\n\nAs for the events wrapping up without really leading anywhere, I don't see how it could have gone any other way. Lee obviously cares for his family, but he was put into an impossible situation and didn't have the tools to deal with it. \n\nIm not saying any of this to argue or tell you that you're wrong. Quite the contrary, you make valid points and back them up with specifics. Where you think this movie could use a bit of editing, I think the editing would have made it felt less genuine. ",

Is he speaking of his depression? Is he really without hope? What do you think he is saying there?\n\nI think the ending IS open-ended, but not so much in regard to WHAT happens as to how that outcome is perceived by the viewer- in a positive or negative light.  I think it's fairly clear: Lee will be moving back to Boston, Patrick will be staying with George until coming of age, and they both have interest in remaining close in the future.  Personally, I see it as positive and with the possibility for a stronger family.  Lee seems to be hopeful but realizes he needs time.\n\nOverall I really liked this film.

It was as if they thought that removing purpose, drama, or conflict from a lot of the scenes would make the movie more realistic, but it's actually the opposite. It just feels lifeless. \n\nYou get these endless shots of scenery, of the characters talking about mundane bullshit, the kid playing in his band, the kid flirting with his girlfriends, etc, etc. Its like the filmmakers are suggesting that this is what life is really like, but it isn't. My life doesn't feel like that, at least. Even when much less is going on than in the film, there is constantly conflict, feeling, drama, etc. I don't feel like they captured that aspect of life, at all. Everything is detached and meandering. Cinematic language is meant to translate this non-physical aspect of life (feelings, emotion) onto the screen, and present visually something that is typically only felt. A forty-second shot of a boat moving through water is not authentic - in fact, its completely inauthentic, and this movie was full of useless moments like this. ",

Maybe that was an intentional juxtaposition, but it took me out of the film's climactic moments.\n\nI think the editing and direction being boring is intentional; to me, this was a film about using everyday moments as a foil to show Lee's brokenness.  Dwelling on awkward moments (like when Lee cannot talk to people) is a way to show what Lee is really like, and not just the highlights.\n\nI think Lonergan's theatre background might play a part as well--you get a lot of very basic shots and just let the acting do the work.  I think this film would have been very easy to over-direct or over-edit; since it's a film so much about realism, a very formalistic take would have been very out of place--which is why the score didn't work for me.",

How Kenneth Lonergan is able to keep the gut wrenching nature of the story and mix that up with humor all over the film is beyond me really. And simply because of that, this film feels very real and relatable to me.\n\nAlso, for all the problems this film has, the tragic scene that cuts between Lee in the lawyer's office and the past was exceptional.

Both were heavy, had some real despair and moving moments, and a bittersweet ending.  \n\nCasey Affleck had an amazing performance of someone who was emotionally destroyed by his past.  He conveyed that guilt and resignation, regret, and wanting to punished.  \n\nMoonlight really shared some great performers among a bunch of actors (my favorite being the drug dealer in the first act, the guy from House of Cards and 4400 - that guy has really improved!).  But Afleck really heald a performance through all stages of his grief, which I give a bit more admiration to.  \n\nBoth were great movies, but perhaps being a white catholic guy from the NE gave me a bit more of an ability to relate, versus a black gay male growing up in utter poverty.  \n\nBoth were able to tackle some really heavy and depressing events/lives without feeling utterly depressed at the end.  It wasn't sad for the sake of pulling the audience to tears, but more to show the beauty and pain of guilt and shame.\n\nI wouldn't be upset if either won best picture.  But I think Affleck has surpassed his brother as a lead, has more depth (and I still like Ben despite shit pop movies).  I really hope he gets the win.\n\nFor directing, its close, but Moonlight had more of a style to it that mixed pastel colors into the story in a way that was very immersive.  \n\nGood movie year - I just hope best picture doesn't go to Lala Land, which IMO was almost written to appeal to the Academy Awards by checking all the boxes that hollywood likes in a best picture.  It was good, but not great.  And personally, I left it not really having any of the songs stick with me.  the movie kinda peaks in the opening highway scene.",

It's painfully dark satire of the folk scene in Greenwich in the 60's. Here you have a man who is brimming with talent, and yet he treats everyone like shit so no one really takes him seriously. Meanwhile he's living with his partners suicide and a potential kid on the way further fucking up his life. Records a joke of a song, almost makes it big... but he took the easy pay-out to finance another abortion. Dude is trapped in a cage of his own making and he's too proud to see it. Brilliant.\n\nWhat do you consider real movies? ",

And to say that nothing happens is a bit of a stretch, yeah there are no action scenes or any big physical challenges,  because the main story is about the internal issues Casey Afflecks character is dealing with.  \n\n I thought his performance was great and while he didn't verbalise a lot of what he was going  through you could see it in the way he carried himself. And to me I thought the subtlety was the best part, it could have very easily been a melodramatic ham-fisted movie but I thought it gave a pretty honest approach to how people can cope with guilt and grief.

The characters all knew the brother's eventual death was coming, as they were told the life expectancy in the flashback was not all that long. So it can be understandable if most, if not all, were mournful but not overly emotional as you seem to want.\n\nI find that what the movie bring is a level of truth that isn't seen in most of movies I seen this year. It's a small story, yes, but it's something I can empathize and on some level relate to. I didn't need anything else from it.  Sorry it couldn't bring you the same satisfaction.\n",

We see his father with he and his brother in the police station and it appears he grabbed his chest when Lee went for the gun.  Did he die as a result of a heart attack that night?  You would think he would have been there when he left his brother and Patrick to move to Boston.  \n\nAlso the scene towards the end in which he is helping the older man fix his furnace is troubling.  When I heard the story of the man's father dying when he took his boat out in the weather that was not that bad and noone found the boat made me think that Lee got an idea here and was going to do this.  When the film ended I thought we were suppose to assume that now that Patrick was ok and was going to be adopted that Lee was going to kill himself by capsizing the boat at sea.\n",

After that near-repeat, the film is edited to see him act in rapidity.\n\nI think you make a great point about Lee getting to know himself in the context of other people, especially since he exiled himself after the fire.

Many have build up to moments of catharsis, or at least a recognizable climax or something. Something \"explosive\" in a dramatic sense, but even the most explosive moments here (Lee's suicide attempt or Patrick's panic attack) felt kinda slow and uneventful. This is not a bad thing.

But now I realize it's meant to be a realistic journey and even though Lee didn't do the things I wanted him to do, he at least made those small changes to have some growth as a character. ",

It's visually and viscerally stunning (A+ Cinematography), but how can you assail the movies above for having nothing happen, when Fury Road suffers from the same underlying issue. There is no real plot and nothing really happens in the story. You are watching a guy try and survive an onslaught for 2 hours. There is virtually no acting, no meaningful dialogue, and no character development.\n\nI disagree, but also I should say that Fury Road stands out from any movie really of the past 15 years. I hesitate to mention how great it is, because people think I'm some Transformers junkie who just likes shit to blow up.\n\nMad Max Fury Road is everything that it wants itself to be. You want a fast-paced, action-packed film with amazing visuals and music? Choke it on, motherfucker. We're going to pound you with it until you submit.\n\n>I'm not saying it was a particularly great two years in film, but did you see the Big Short or Ex Machina?\n\nBig Short I wasn't crazy about and I loved Ex Machina. I concede that that Mad Max is the best film of the past 2 years (so far, haven't seen any heavy hitters yet like Fences or La La Land) because it benefits from a particularly weak class.\n\nI have Ex Machina as a close second to Mad Max over the past 2 years.",

It was blatantly manipulative and designed to be emotionally triggering to that demographic.\n\nJust because you were drawn in by the cheap ticks of the lazy plot, does not make this a good film. \n\nCasey Afflek being a moody, violent ass does not mean a powerful performance. \n\nMichelle Williams crying is not Oscar worthy acting. \n\nYou are not special. Nor are they. All families have to deal with grief. As you get older, the more you have to face. Its just a fact of life. \n\nAdult characters acting like teenagers in the face of loss is not compelling or engaging.\n\nTheir grief should have been the background to a bigger story. It should have been the depth behind another plot. But no. \n\nPeople, yourself included, laud the 'truth' or realism of this situation, but 'truth' seems to mean 'uneventful'. It seems to mean ease. It seems to mean 2.5 hours of nothing happening. It just goes to show how sheltered and warped your view of reality actually is. It takes more than washed-out saturation, a swearing teenager and driving scenes to depict reality. \n\nReality is a struggle. The characters in this film had none. The kid inherited an estate worth around $750,000 FFS. This is pure Hollywood trash. \n \nViewed as an adult with real life experience, I will stand by my assertion; this was an overrated TV movie. It was almost insultingly bland, emotionally manipulative (to those that are susceptible - i.e. the target audience), and in no way a real depiction of a slice of life.\n\nSmall stories shouldn't take two and a half hours to tell.

Banal isn't compelling. \n\nBanal and solemn just makes over-earnest movie critics nod their head and applaud the grayness of it all. Banal dupes them into not asking any difficult questions of the movie. \n\nIf you think banal, slow and solemn is what they were trying to achieve, then you've been sucked in by the Hollywood marketing machine.\n\nThis is an old-fashioned TV-movie tear-jerker. Nothing more. It's even badly edited and poorly scored. It's by the book emotionally manipulative. But because people aren't crying, shouting or being OTT melodramatic (though it has its moments), its lauded as a masterpiece study of subtlety. \n\nSubtlety and internal conflict have been done much better many times before. People dealing with their situation in an immature, dull way, with no outside struggle, is not interesting or entertaining to those that see past the bullshit veneer. \n\nThis film does three things well: \n\n1) It dupes people (mainly women) into caring with emotionally manipulative themes. \n\n2) It successfully, but pretentiously elevates itself above TV-movie trash by removing all emotion, vibrancy or plot, and masquerades as a \"slow, solemn movie covering the banality of unfolding events and characters, wherein the conflict is mostly internal, subtle and unspoken\".\n\n3) By being moody, dour and uneventful, it will achieve its ultimate goal - to be showered with Oscars.

The way she gets hysterical trying to justify her actions and him trying to bed his torrent of feelings was a fantastic dynamic. The emotion was raw, uncomfortable and unfiltered. You could tell he wanted more than anything to rekindle his old life, but he felt too betrayed and he found more comfort in not having to feel at all.

You're the one that is using anecdotal evidence to assume no kid is prepared to deal with loss whatsoever. I'm sure maturity, reassurance and support play a big role in helping children overcome grief. \n\nThis film was more art than documentary and being so I can attach all the interpretation to any given scene I desire. Patrick was hardly a kid. He was a young man and seemed very well put together. He knew his father was in dire straights from frequent visits to the hospital so I can assume that, although still tough to deal with his loss, he was better able to mentally prepare and took it in stride much better than Lee's surprise tragedy. He may not be willingly distracting himself to stave off grief, but the truth is that he had a lot going on for him in the movie and he simply didn't have the time (that Lee has) to dwell on his loss. They're from two completely different perspectives/mindsets. Patrick is just starting his life so he's a lot more optimistic, Lee struggles letting go and fears starting over. Patrick may be dealing with his loss better out of pure naivete, but it still think that ball scene illustrated their respective thought processes well.",

I find your analysis of the movie somewhat effortless, maybe the film just didn't resonate with you somehow. \nI found the raw humanity of this movie in a subject that many people dont like to deal with very enthralling. Lonergan was interviewed on Fresh Air recently and he said this, \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to move on from their feelings of loss, my father passed away this year and you don\u2019t want to leave them behind, you don\u2019t want to get over it and feel great about it, you feel like you owe it to the people you\u2019ve lost to carry that pain around with you in some form.\u201d This statement was so profound for me.

There's no falling action, no moment of reflection, just cause and effect. Selfish characters making selfish choices in their quest for control. As an audience we are conditioned to expect some semblance of redemption for these people, but it never comes. They are beyond redemption, sinner and saint alike. Greed wins. That's the payoff. \n\nAs far as LLewyn Davis goes, I have no idea what you're talking about with this symbolism mumbo jumbo. It's a top ten movie for me, I've watched it many times, yet I haven't spent a single solitary moment scavenging for hidden tidbits of meaning. I love the movie because it is a funny fucking film whilst also making me want to weep. One moment I'm railing against the injustice of the world to not recognize his talent, and in the next I'll be grinning because even though I want Llewyn to succeed, in truth he deserves everything he gets. He's a martyr for himself. That is a hard thing to pull off. The moment when he's lying in the alley and Dylan comes onstage moments later playing in the background. The dramatic irony in that scene is a beating far worse than the physical one he had just endured.\n \nGood list. Some damn good movies on there.\n\n\n",

What stands out to me the most is when I first saw it, I thought Christian Bale (possibly my favorite actor) turned in the worst, most over the top cariacture of a role I had ever seen. Then I saw the over the top, crazy guy he played in real life and thought it was a master-class of a role.\n\n>The Descendants\n\nI'm also very hit and miss on Alexander Payne. I do love Election and Sideways very dearly. This has its moments, and is probably what Manchester By The Sea wanted to be. Kept my attention. A film I respected but did not enjoy.\n\n>Moonlight\n\nHave not seen.\n\n>Silver Linings Playbook?\n\nOne of my David O. Russell hits. Huge fan. Now this is a movie that gets grief right in my book.",

Financially, his nephew was accounted for and his guardianship rights were passed along to George. He could have, by all accounts, resumed his position and living arrangements in Boston.\n\nHe progressed gradually. He was opposed to keeping the boat after speaking with the lawyer, and then capitulated to his nephew about investigating the motor problems with George's help. His next step was identifying his brother's rifles and eventually selling them to pay for a new motor, something his nephew wanted from the beginning. The scene directly after, he inquired about work where before, he was adamant about moving back to Boston as quickly as possible. I think it suggests that over time, interacting with his nephew made him consider laying down roots again. \n\nThe lawyer discussed options vaguely with him when Lee read the will. He floated George as a possible guardian, and after months of slowly battling, George was eventually asked to take Patrick in.\n\nI have to disagree completely. I thought the character development was good, and where you felt it may have stagnated, I felt it was a reflection of the immense grief people go through and the way it binds some of us to a life of simple existence.\n\nLee made seemingly minute changes, after repeatedly denying the need to make them, as time went on. They may have seemed small, but given the incredible losses he suffered, I believed that a man that broken would experience change, no matter how slight, at that pace. ",

            "body": "But that's kind of the point, isn't it? It's not about whatever bullshit they teach in Screenwriting 101. The movie is a reflection of reality. In movies like Good Will Hunting, it all boils down to one big \"eureka\" moment of catharsis, where the protagonist confronts their demons and cries for a bit - and then, boom, the trauma is gone. When does that ever happen in real life? How can it possibly work like that? The kind of shit that the character of Lee Chandler has gone through in Manchester will haunt him for the rest of his life. He's never coming back from that.\n\nKenneth Lonergan, the movie's writer and director, has gone on record criticising Hollywood movies for their clear-cut depiction of personal growth in that way. How can spending a few weeks or months or even years with his nephew lead to Lee suddenly moving past what happened to him? If you genuinely think this movie would have a good ending if Lee suddenly goes, \"Being with you has taught me so much and now I am ready to face the world again!\", then I stand by my original statement: on a deep-seated, fundamental level, you simply do not understand this movie.\n\nSorry if you're not comfortable with the lack of miraculous recovery, sorry if it doesn't fit in with your film school cookie-cutter ideal of how movies should be made, but that's how trauma works in real life, so deal with it.",

In fact, it's frustrating.\n\n> Also the damn organ music was too overused and drawn out during some of the more important scenes which really ruined it for me.\n\nDefinitely felt out of place, especially when the shot changed and the music just kept on going.  It was overpowering for several minutes during integral parts of the film and I just don't understand why they wouldn't have a bit more restraint.\n\nLike when Casey Affleck first walks in and sees his brother in the morgue -- they didn't have any music, they didn't have Affleck break down or overact -- it was quiet, intimate, and not drawn out.  One of the strongest scenes in the film in my opinion.",

Too little to be satisfying, and too little to justify the melodrama in the film.\n\nMelodrama works well with strong and pronounced character arcs. \n\n> I have to disagree completely. I thought the character development was good, and where you felt it may have stagnated, I felt it was a reflection of the immense grief people go through and the way it binds some of us to a life of simple existence.\n\nI mean it is a reflection of grief.  But with no real catharsis and everything just sort of happening to the characters without them reacting much, it felt like it meandered. \n\nAnd with the tonal inconsistencies, it was even harder to get invested.  I feel the film needed to be focused and polished.\n\n[I elaborated more on my thoughts here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5kbswd/manchester_by_the_sea_discussion_for_those_of_us/dbmua81/).",

The movie dragged on and the nonlinear approach didn't help.  The film was in need of simplifying and streamlining.  \n\nI didn't find it added much variety -- a lot of the flashbacks were equally relentlessly depressing as the scenes set in present day.  I mean the entirety of the house fire scene is in flashback -- and the overbearing music and slow motion makes it so melodramatic.\n\nThe fact that most of the flashbacks are exposition doesn't help, either.  It draws us away from the conflict and hurts the pacing.",
