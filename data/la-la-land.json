I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.  I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.\" \n",

Remember the one scene where Seb is describing jazz to Mia and how even though it can be the same song it is never played the same way twice and at different times the drummer or sax player might go off and do their own thing and play the song their way. And throughout the movie there would be times when they would just focus on Mia or Seb and the decision they are making (see Seb playing piano in the restaurant or Mia's final audition). Then in the final scene at the club we see how their lives could have been different together if they made different decisions. But they always start at the restaurant and end at the club. So just like a jazz song can be played a little bit differently depending on the musicians decide to play it, it still is the same song that starts and ends the same way. Just like they meet at the restaurant and end at the club. ",

Additionally, they do not end up together in much the same way, as they both have to live their respective lives and thus can't be together. Just like Rick and Ilsa will \"always have Paris\", Mia and Sebastian will always have Los Angeles. That ending was so sad and sweet, and it really made me think of Casablanca, even in the way that Mia's new husband seems like such a good guy, just how Victor was a great man in Casablanca, conflicting our feelings about the way the main couple does not end up together.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

There's many historical spots that back in the day were popular, awesome, or just part of culture or held importance. Then today those places are either closed down, torn down and replaced by a skyscraper or something else, or not valued at all. Angel's Flight was something I saw it often growing up and seeing it go up and down in the middle of the day made me want to ride it one day. It looked cool. Now it's closed (temporarily I think) and it bums me I never got to ride it. \n\nA lot of places basically require someone to claim it and take care of it, government to landmark it, or support of a group. Otherwise, it's lost forever because the general population moves and doesn't value the importance of it. That's what's happening to Jazz. That's what Seb is worried about. Jazz has an important historical impact but it's sound is being changed. Seb doesn't think it's right for traditional Jazz to die out, but no one cares because it's no one is valuing it.\n\nJust my take on that quote. It hit me hard. Was pretty deep. ",

I think I've fallen in love with Emma Stone. \n\nDid anyone notice how the final scene was basically Casablanca? Of all the gin joints in all the world, she walks into mine (with her husband). Then they listen to a piano piece and imagine what could've been. But in the end it wasn't meant to be.\n\nI *personally* was very disappointed that they didn't stay together in the end. I totally understand why, and it was very reminiscent of Casablanca and An American in Paris with the bittersweet ending. The only thing I would say is Hollywood Oscar movies try to shy away from happy endings over the past few years because the \"happily ever after\" ending is considered silly. (Even La La Land mocks the idea.) BUT the movie was FULL of \"happily ever after\" events. The barista gets discovered and becomes a huge star. That doesn't happen in real life! That's silly. And grumpy losers don't get invited into popular bands. Haha. I mean there's a scene of dancing in outer space for crying out loud. There's already so much happiness and silliness and rule bending in the movie, a \"happily ever after\" ending would've worked fine. \n\nThe bittersweet ending of Casablanca works so much better because it had to be that way. Rick couldn't get with the women he loves because she was married (and the dude was a great guy), and as a couple they were so important to the war effort. In La La Land, it's like they couldn't be together.... because??? It's not even like the excuse was that Mia was too busy for a relationship (she ended up getting married anyway) or that Ryan Gosling's character had something to do that would prevent him from being in a relationship (he just played a piano lol).\n\nI thought the ending was very well done, but personally would've enjoyed a happy ending more. Even if the characters weren't together, just hint that they *could* be together if they chose. Maybe I'm just a sucker.",

A love-story musical is a recipe for being quickly dismissed as light fluff by many moviegoers, yet I really appreciated how La La Land addressed the difficulties of achieving what you want to do in life.  Emphasis on the doing part.  It's less about whether two people will get together and live happily ever after, and more about two people each trying to do what they love.  Anyway, I could write a lot about this movie, so I'll just share some random things I liked:  [1. starting the movie with a classic LA traffic jam that transitions into the movie's first song.  The final shot of endless cars on the expressway with a person standing on each one was major eye-candy for me.  2. I liked how the planetarium scene was one of the more dream-like parts yet was fairly low-key.  The movie saved the epic montage stuff for the epilogue near the end of the movie.  3. The scene in which Emma Stone says there is no way she's going to the major audition, and Ryan Gosling yells \"WHAT?!\"  It was probably his only outburst the entire movie, and it was great like a well-timed f-word in a PG-13 movie.  4. Emma Stone from start to finish, especially the funny bit when she playfully dances to Gosling's band's music, as well as her \"crying like a baby\" breakdown when he tells her about the big audition opportunity.  I found it surprisingly moving, and I'm glad that Gosling's reaction was both realistic and comedic.  5. The couple's arguments were realistic and not overly dramatic: showing up to each other's performances, going on tour, etc.  6. \"City of Stars\"  7. The colors   8. The balance between songs and normal scenes.  For a musical, it didn't feel like an endless stream of songs.  9. One more time: everything Emma Stone](#spoiler)",

I was wrapped up in the music, the visuals, and of course the sweet and sincere chemistry that Ryan and Emma have in every movie they're in together. I couldn't help but feel this sense of dread all throughout the movie, thinking; \"this isn't going to end well\". Last quarter of the movie, eyes welled up realizing that they don't end up together and then the montage of \"what could have been\" played, and the tears started rolling down (I rarely cry if that means anything). The movie made me reflect upon the reality that as one gets older you're stuck with the decisions that you've made and I often find myself looking back and thinking how different my life would be if I went a different path here and there. But life is not a Hollywood movie -- not La La Land where everything works out perfectly. For Mia and Sebastian, sometimes achieving their dream is worth more than the love they had and that's perfectly fine. People come and go in your life but that doesn't lessen their lasting impact on you. They both realized that and walked away, secure in the fact that the love they have for each other will always be there, even if they're not together.",

I feel like my interpretation of the ending is a bit different from a lot of what I'm seeing on here, [a lot of people see the last montage as a \"what could've been\" scenario, but to me it seemed like the message was that the narrative depicted there was an idealized, perfect Hollywood story that never could have happened in real life. It starts with Seb kissing Mia completely out of the blue at the club, and goes on to depict his boss as being an upbeat guy instead of the tense man he actually was, and shows Mia performing her play in front of a full house instead of a small group. All of these changes make for an overall unrealistic and unattainable story. To me, this represents the classic, cookie cutter Hollywood movie that La La Land is not, even with the movie's nods to classic Hollywood. This overly idealized ending also could illustrate that Mia and Seb's romance was a product of convenience and timing, and not a result of the pair being \"soul mates.\"](#spoiler)",

It's not that I don't appreciate the work that goes into the choreography, or that I can't suspend disbelief when people burst into song. It's that the type of music in musicals just isn't my thing. It always seems to have this campy, overly theatrical style that I don't care for. I can usually deal with it in the context of the movie or play but let's just say you won't find me listening to the Rocky Horror or Wicked soundtracks on their own like I might with my favorite instrumental film scores. Because of that, musicals tend to drag for me even if they have a decent story. I just can't get into them like a lot of people can, because the story has to stop every few minutes for a song I'll most likely never want to listen to again. \n\nI loved every second of this movie, including and especially all the music. Every scene, every song, was pure magic. I bought the soundtrack at Barnes & Noble today during my Christmas shopping after seeing it for the first time last night. The way the themes are used to further the story is brilliant. The score is beautiful and so well-arranged, and the songs are so ridiculously catchy and infectious and full of joy you can't help but love them. [The song Emma Stone sings for her big audition scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwjalGJo7vA) gave me goosebumps in the theater. Maybe the music really is that much better than other musicals. Maybe Chazelle is just that good a director and managed to bring the songs to life onscreen like he did with the jazz pieces in Whiplash (which were great on their own, as someone who likes jazz) - seriously, that opening scene on the freeway or the dance at the observatory, holy shit this man was born to direct extended scenes based around a piece of music. But whatever the reason is, I've never felt this attached to the soundtrack of a musical before. \n\nGosling and Stone were brilliant of course. The script is a classic Hollywood romance with a nice modern twist. Great cinematography, editing, all that. But what really amazed me about this was that I went to see a musical almost solely because I loved Whiplash, expecting to be moved by the story but not the singing, and ended up humming the songs all the way home. Thank you, Justin Hurwitz. Thank you, Damien Chazelle. Thank you to everyone who made La La Land. It's a great movie that just makes you feel good inside, which is something we need right now. See it alone, see it with your girlfriend, see it with your grandparents, see it with your grouchy twentysomething friend who doesn't like musicals. Just see it!",

We see the two stars willing to take chances to follow their dreams but what we see through out is that they can never seem to find a way to be happy together while also being happy with themselves. So when the end rolls around and we see [that they have both achieved the dream they set out to live and they are apart the audience suddenly is filled with a sadness. This is achieved because the story focused on what we leave behind when we follow our dreams. Pursuing your passion means making sacrifices.

Someone she claimed to love forever, someone who loved her, and someone without whom she wouldn't have had her dreams? If that's the case, then maybe she didn't love him as much as he loved her.

I'm kinda bracing myself for the backlash here though - there's a lot of Whiplash's DNA in La La Land. They're not cousins, they're siblings. I'm hoping that Chazelle has something else up his sleeve so he's not a one trick pony - for now, we have this cotton candy treat that makes my eyes well up and puts a lump in my throat from all its hope and bittersweetness. When the tagline says 'here's to the fools who dream,' that's exactly who the film is for.\n\nIt's destined to win Best Picture at the Oscars at this point, and I'm hoping for the biggest sweep since Slumdog Millionaire.

I think this is a good example of how enthusiasm and honest passion are better than raw talent.\n\nAnyways, this movie isn't great because of any one reason.

Life is beautiful, even with pain, and that's what this movie celebrates so wonderfully.\n\nThere aren't really enough songs to consider this a true musical like My Fair Lady or Chicago (my personal two favorites) but all the same I've never seen a musical set in modern times that was actually good, until this one. \n\n",

            "body": "I just saw this movie today and I honestly have to say, this was by far my best movie of 2016! This movie charmed the hell out of me and was able to pull off something I've really never seen in a movie which was being able to be at times a huge spectacle of a movie while, also being very quiet and reserved at others.\n\nStone and Gosling have some of the best chemistry I've seen in actors in years past and I loved how well they worked off of each other.\n\nThe soundtrack was amazing and even though I only saw it not even 6 hours ago I already have pretty much every song on my phone and have had it on repeat for ours now (I think my personal favorite is A Lovely Night, that scene was amazing.)\n\nHowever, I think my favorite thing about this movie is that on the surface it completely seems like just another musical but, if you just look a little deeper it has some really strong things to say about chasing your dreams and relationships and the fact that the two don't always intertwine. I think this movie was probably the best example I've ever seen of the quote, \"if you love something let it go.\" Sebastian easily could have not told Mia about the audition and just let her live at home with her parents and give up but, he cared about her just enough to know that she needed to achieve her goals even though he knew what that meant for their relationship. He was willing to let her chase her dreams as she had forced him to chase his and put her wellbeing and happiness before his even though he knew what would happen to them if she got the role and if that's not love, I don't know what is.   \n\nWhile I know some people hated the ending, and it is quite bittersweet, I actually found it quite refreshing. Though it was sad that they didn't end up together and I found their love story to be one of the most compelling I've ever seen, I realized, neither of them would have gotten what they truly wanted if they stayed together. It showed in the alternate reality that Seb wouldn't own a club and would instead have been still sitting with Mia watching somebody else live out his dream while Mia would still be struggling. I think it shows they needed each other to push each other and have somebody to lean on but, once they each found steady footing that initial need was lost. I think it's a great message that even though a relationship may not last, it doesn't mean you should regret it or that you never needed each other. Neither of them would have gotten where they ended up without each other, they were both just a very important part of each other's bigger story.",

It's not that there's anything inherently wrong with them &amp;amp;amp; I appreciate the talent involved, I just personally have never cared for them. Never been able to find one that I truly enjoyed.\n\nUntil now.\n\nWhat a great movie. Emma Stone was great but I thought Gosling was even greater. The movie was a perfect blend of musical, romance, drama, and ample dose of comedy (mostly coming from Gosling). Cinematography was on point. Only two things I truly didn't care for: the opening traffic jam sequence was... Eh, I dunno. Kind of unnecessary, and even more so being made to look like one take felt a little gimmicky. Also the part in the observatory where they literally float upwards and share a short dance in the cosmos. The entire movie has a whimsical, dreamy quality that still stays grounded in the surrealism to a point, but this small sequence felt too hokey in comparison. Honestly I wish they would've just done a musical number around the observatory floor or something.\n\nBut those are small gripes in comparison to how great everything else was. Stone has a much better voice than I would have anticipated; Gosling's kind of pales in comparison but it ironically works because, after all, he's a jazz piano player, not a singer. It's almost part of the charm.\n\nI really liked the choice to NOT have them end up together because if they DID end up together, it would've been way too premeditated and clich\u00e9. Instead we have a fantastically bittersweet flashback \"what-could-have-been\" sequence that plants a solemn pit in your stomach and gives the finale an intangible melancholic quality.",

            "body": "Primary colors! Primary colors and green are abound in this film. One thing I could say about Damian Chazelle's \"La La Land\" is that it is vivid. \"La La Land\" is about the relationship of two L.A. artists, Sebastian (Ryan Goslin) and Mia (Emma Stone), as they navigate through their careers. Chazelle tells this story through the use of musical scores, \"seasonal transitions\" (it's L.A.), and visual bliss. The audience sees how the characters feel. Sebastian and Mia's time at the observatory is an example of good visual storytelling. Both Ryan Goslin and Emma Stone are amazing in their roles. Their portrayal is very convincing and makes the audience care for their characters and their relationship. However, the music, which is a character itself in the film, really drives the film. Chazelle is no doubt a fan of Jazz, and he uses the genre to build and end Sebastian and Mia's relationship. The ending is very impactful. It highlights both Sebastian and Mia's desires to be with one another while acknowledging the price they paid for success. It is my belief that the title, \"La La Land,\" stems from the final scene. \n\nOverall, \"La La Land\" is a film that needs to be seen on either the biggest screen or 4K capable television set. It uses Jazz to tell a colorful story about two LA artists tied between their relationship and their careers. The ending is very effective, and the movie's cast is great. Again, I highly recommend this film be seen in theatres. \n\n",

Whiplash is in my top 5 movies of all time so I was absolutely dying waiting to see this and I thought Damien Chazelle came through again with this. the music was beautiful and flowed well through the movie. the story wasn't revolutionary or anything but it didn't need to be Gosling and Stone had such great chemistry that it worked so well. but the Cinematography and the Choreography was what stole the show. this movie was absolutely gorgeous.\n\nSome scenes that I loved that I haven't seen people talk much about include Sebastian walking Mia to her car after the party and then you realize his car was at the house the whole time and he walked with her just to talk, really loved that detail. Sebastian and Mia in the movie theater when their hands touch and they start to lean in to kiss, I think this scene was fantastic because a lot of people can relate to that feeling and wanting to be in that same situation it was really well done and I enjoyed how slow they took it. I also thought the movie was really funny and the biggest laugh from me was when Seb thought Mia blew him off at her parents house in Nevada so he drives away right as she reaches for the door, Goslings quick little \"yeah for sure\" when Mia explains she got coffee was hilarious and reminded me of how goofy and clueless his character was in the Nice Guys.\n\nand of course the scenes that everyone have been talking about were fantastic. the opening sequence was incredibly impressive and just awesome to start off with. the Observatory scene was beautiful and emotional and fun to see. but holy shit that ending sequence. as someone who wants to leave his hometown to work on his dream career but is afraid to move away and give up a \"normal life\" in pursuit of a dream, this scene fucked me up. seeing the alternate reality of what could have been and if they both could have been happy with that other life was so sad. I'm just glad that the movie ended with both Seb and Mia smiling to each other. they had to sacrifice their relationship in order to achieve their original dreams before each other and I don't know if it was necessarily worth it to them but I think they're both proud and happy for each other, which matters I think.\n\nloved the movie so much. so happy for Damien Chazelle who has now made two amazing movies in my opinion",

This would be entirely unthinkable to me.  I feel like it kind of shows how caught up in the magic she actually is.  My friend thought that the casting director called Sebastian's phone looking for her, but I don't think this is the case, because he drives all the way to Nevada without calling her instead.  \n\n**Keith** (John Legend):  We know that there's a bit of animosity between him and Sebastian, and I initially thought that he was maybe the guy who ripped him off.  This clearly isn't the case, but they make a point for us to know that there is some begrudged past between the two characters.  The easy interpretation is that they represent old vs. new jazz, but does anyone think there might be a bit more depth to it?",

I found the juxtaposition of the scenes five years later showing a successful Mia and her husband and Seb in his club with those of \"what could have been\" satisfied both the part of me that wanted their love to triumph and the part of me that wanted them both to be successful in achieving their dreams. This film is one that shows the tug of war between love and success, one that exposes the happy and sad realities of life, even through a fantastical lens. What I loved so much about the ending was the way that the shared \"fantasy\" gave us as audience members not a perfect \"Hollywood Ending\", but rather an alternate and just as plausible reality, one in which Mia and Sebastian stay in love and stay together, but cannot succeed in following their dreams. Mia doesn't become wildly famous as an actress, as evidenced through the smaller home and suburban life, and Seb can't open his club, shown by the mere fact that it is a different man sitting at the piano when Mia and Sebastian enter the club in the last few seconds of the \"fantasy\". This gives us as the audience the ability to make the same choice that Mia and Sebastian do, to embrace the ending of both characters achieving their dreams at the expense of love, or enjoy the fantasy in which the two can be together, without their greatest aspirations coming to fruition. Chazelle sets up this almost choice by presenting the two contrasting yet parallel realities to create an ending that is for an audience member \"conflict and compromise and very very exciting\" (Not sure if I got that quote right). The ending makes us feel as conflicted, excited, and forced to compromise as Mia and Sebastian are when we decide which fate is better, a theme emblematic of the entire film.](#spoiler)",

Even Miles Davis experimented with distortion and a wah-wah peddle on the Live-Evil album. (If you haven't heard it, look it up) \n\n* Neither character is defined by much more than their artistic ambitions. I don't know much about who Mia is, aside from her dreams of being a great actress like her aunt.  Even the grand conflict of the third act is centered around whether or not she'll give up her dreams. \n\n* The movie is a wish-fulfillment, struggling artist fairytale. This is never more explicit than it is in the third act. Mia is heartbroken because nobody came to and/or liked her show, so she gives up and moves home. But her moment of crisis is resolved because it turns out that a casting director was there, and she wants to give Mia an audition for a project that \"has no script and will be built around the actress.\"\n\nThe film is gorgeous, and the epilogue specifically is utterly charming. \n\nBut I didn't love it the way i had hoped I would. \n\nOf the three big \"best picture\" contenders this year, **La La Land** is likely my least favorite. \n\n",

I echo the sentiment of some of the other people on here, as well. Miles Teller would have been just awful in the leading role. I don't see him as being nearly as likable as Gosling, and with his characterization, he has to be likable for the movie to be tolerable. I also think that there was a noticeable lack of music in the second half, but it didn't bother me too much.\n\nThe entire thing was very nostalgic, but to me it never felt too heavy-handed or pandering. This may be a controversial thing to say on this sub, but I partially agree with some reviewers who say that the whole thing is awkward for never addressing the racial aspect of jazz. I wouldn't go so far as to say that the movie is racist, but I certainly see where that complaint comes from.  Unfortunately, when you make a movie that's meant to capture the nostalgic feeling of old Hollywood, you're going to run into some of old Hollywood's pitfalls, too. \n\nAll in all, this is a movie that I think is worth seeing just for how it *looks*.

That opening scene was fucking fantastic, and so was the second musical number with Mia\u2019s roommates. \n\n* Acting was good, Emma & Ryan's chemistry and charm, seen already in *Crazy, Stupid, Love*, is abundant. They did reasonably well with the singing considering they're actors first. It seemed like they had way less lines than the usual movie, but they did a great job conveying emotion without talking. Apparently Gosling actually spent a lot of time learning piano for this, which, as a piano player, is pretty legit. \n\n* I\u2019m not a big on musicals, I\u2019m watching a show right now (*Crazy Ex-Girlfriend*) and I feel like the songs don't add enough to be worthwhile, but I thought this was a great movie for people who share similarly lukewarm sentiments. The second the movie started, any reservations I had about the film were gone. \nI **loved** the soundtrack, first thing I did when I got out of the theatre was look it up and download it. I found myself smiling whenever their theme song came on in it\u2019s various renditions, and there wasn\u2019t so much singing that it distracted from the story. \n\nOther thoughts:\n\n* The anachronism took me out of the moment, especially in the beginning, like seeing all the old cars, then she has a Prius, or her iPhone. Reminded me of Archer where you don\u2019t know what decade they're in. \n\n* I have mixed feelings about the ending. I thought it did a decent job of conveying the theme of making hard sacrifices for your dream, and it feels especially relevant in this generation, with increasingly more young professionals & entrepreneurs (especially women) becoming career-oriented. On the other hand, I feel like movies are actively trying to avoid the \"Hollywood ending\", which isn't a bad thing, but I would've preferred the happy ending this time. It also rings a little hollow, because there\u2019s an overwhelming amount of people (especially the creative types in LA) who will never experience Seb/Mia's storybook success.\n\n* As someone who lives in LA, the movie left me with a bittersweet feeling. There\u2019s still that palpable sense of wonder and opportunity, and I\u2019ll definitely be re-visiting all of the filming locations. But a) traffic is soul-sucking and b) the gentrification and development of the city makes it hard to actually experience LA like a movie. Seb's line about \"It's LA, where people worship everything, but value nothing\u201d sounded a bit too edgy, but the sentiment is true. And I\u2019m saying this as someone who's bougie as fuck and loves modern development lol.\n\nOverall: 9/10, definitely see this and be ready for the feels.",

After Whiplash and now this I honestly consider Damien Chazelle the best filmmaker of his generation, seriously there were long takes in this to make Inarritu and Cuaron envious and he's still really young. Saying that I still found the ending a little bit of a downer in that although the theme of the film is about persuing your dreams the relationship between Seb and Mia felt more genuine than that and their break up seemed a little forced in order to create the melancholy ending (seriously could they not have just skyped each other for a few months?).

They had SO may opportunities to cop out/sell out in story, music, or dialogue, but they stood firm with their vision until the end. I think a perfect example of this is [the ending. The final sequence in the club was so emotional and creative, and when she looked back, I was PRAYING she wouldn't run into his arms and confess her love.

In many modern 'romance' films, the relationship feels plastic and unrealistic. While obviously exaggerated in some ways to maintain the feel of the film, their relationship was so believable and tangible. I am not going to lie, my faith in those actors had been slightly shaken the last few years, but this redeemed them entirely and then some.\n\nI will say, however, that I wasn't a HUGE fan of the opening song. I remember looking over at my brother who sung it's praises for WEEKS and just raising my eyebrow in doubt and confusion. It felt (and I apologize for the use of this word, as it's a lazy and easy term) so millennial and unfitting with the rest of the film. I almost felt like they were going to try to sell me a Mazda or something. The second song was notably better but still a little too...I dunno, unremarkable? However, once the ending rolled around, I did develop quite an appreciation for the intro. The movie truly felt like it matured as the characters did, though I am not sure if this was intentional. I wouldn't put it past the incredible people behind this film.\n\nAll in all, this film is a rare masterpiece that I doubt we'll find again any time soon. It's a love letter to the Singing in the Rains and Holiday Inns that used to be a staple of the United States, as well as a tasteful rekindling of modern day romance films. I cannot praise this film enough. While I don't love conventional rating systems, this is an EASY 9.5/10, probably higher.",

            "body": "**[Contains Spoilers - Please don't read further if you haven't seen the movie]**\n\nI couldn't help but to have a bittersweet feeling about the movie. While it seems like Sebastian and Mia are soul mates that should end up together at the end, they don't. More specifically, it seemed like Mia's decision to marry and start a family with another man was one of innocence, of inevitability, of public acceptance as queued by Sebastian's lonesome smile at the end of the movie despite the fact that they had both expressed their love for each other. It was hard for me to stomach that ending as well as people's full acceptance of it. Let me provide further context.\n\n**This is my thinking-**\n\nSebastian and Mia helped each other pursue each other's dreams - for Sebastian, it was resurrecting traditional jazz by opening his own jazz club. For Mia, it was telling stories in her unique way as an actress. Along the way, they fell in love with each other's held passion toward achieving their respective dreams. \n\nThis relationship development in the movie leads the viewers to want to believe that their mutual love for each other's passion as well as their mutual trust shown through vulnerability create a strong enough pull for both of them to stick together through any obstacle and ultimately end up together at the end of the movie. Sebastian even sacrificed his dream (temporarily) and relationship *for Mia's good, not his* - what selfless acts of love! Shouldn't this kind of love continue and endure in marriage?\n\nNot in La La Land. The pull was indeed strong enough for Sebastian (as evidenced by the dedication of his club to Mia by naming it \"Seb's\" - Mia's recommendation that Seb took out of his trust and love for Mia), but it wasn't strong enough for Mia (she ends up marrying another man). \n\nIn the end, viewers are left in a melancholic mood because they realize that the eternal love they verbally and mutually expressed to each other (\"I'll always love you\") didn't come to fruition.\n\nThis kind of story is reality for so many people - the kind of story where lovers part because the pull wasn't strong enough for one or both parties to hold on to their love throughout the passing seasons of life. I too had feelings of melancholy toward this kind of story and I was especially empathetic towards Sebastian - I know what it's like to feel empty, betrayed almost, to witness a loved one with another man after hearing the words, \"I'll always love you\" from them. \n\n**So I was left helplessly and indignantly asking the following questions:**\n\n* (1) Are people's capabilities of loving another person that weak?\n\n* (2) Which qualities of Sebastian would have prompted a strong enough pull for Mia to reserve her devotion to Sebastian until they meet again?\n\n* (3) Was Mia's marrying another person inevitable in the five years she spent apart from Sebastian?\n\t\n* (3a) Was there something selfless or loving in a person's power that *could've* been done to keep her eternal love for him?\n\n* (3b) Was there something selfless or loving in a person's power that *should've* been done to keep her eternal love for him?\n\n* (4) Which factors could have enabled Sebastian's and Mia's relationship to continue?\n\n**The following is my attempt at answering my questions, which I hope will help me and you avoid an unnecessary heartbreak that Sebastian experienced at the end of the movie upon seeing Mia:**\n\n* (1) Yes, they are weak because the human heart is fickle. The object of human love (as in the qualities people think they need in their partner) changes so frequently because we are unsure of what we really need. It might be inspiration in one season and accountability in another. For Mia, it may have solely been inspiration radiating out of Sebastian's passion in one season and (maybe) maturity to lead her and her future children in another season. Because the object of our love changes so frequently, the duration of love for a particular object or a person can be short and capability to love, weak. \n\n* (2) In order to answer this question, I need to factor in the variable of Mia's changing needs with time. If Sebastian had and showed to Mia the different qualities she needed in the different seasons of her life, I believe she would have been devoted to marrying Sebastian at the end despite the time she spent away from him.\n\n* (3) Yes, it was inevitable if her inner most need changed in the five years, and if she saw that she was able to fulfill that new inner most need with another man.\n\n* (3a) If it was necessary that her needs change as she grows as a person, then may be just one - have faith that Sebastian will have the new qualities she is looking for in her husband. Anything other than that such as calling Sebastian, moving back to LA, etc. would have prevented Sebastian from fully devoting himself to achieving his dream. While having faith could have been a selfless act, it would not have been the most wise act since Sebastian might not have actually had them and she could have missed the opportunity to find a new partner with those qualities during that time.\n\n* (3b) Perhaps, not actively look for another partner (but still be open to the possibility of pursuing a relationship with another partner if that partner, with qualities she most needs, appears). I'm not saying Mia did actively look btw.\n\n* (4) Many things - I'll only touch on three that I think are most important:\n\t\n* (4a) Unchanging inner most needs - I think this is possible only when a person has fairly matured, perhaps after they have realized that satisfaction gained from attaining worldly pursuits and obsessions, (for Sebastian and Mia, it was their dream) fades away. This factor would not have been possible to add to the movie since both of them at the point of their separation were still, to a certain degree, obsessed with achieving their dreams, (\"obsession is a young man's game\") but it's worth to mention it here for the sake of helping readers make wise calls when it comes to deciding when to seriously start dating.\n\n* (4b) Location of Mia's job - proximity to one another could have been fuel for helping keep each other's commitment to always loving one another.\n\n* (4c) Mia's continuing of dreaming for different things in the spirit of her relationship with Sebastian. I can say this only because I'm assuming that Mia's wants, needs and dreams changed while she was separated with Sebastian. If, however, Mia dreamt new dreams that she thinks Sebastian could help her achieve or that Sebastian could similarly dream, she might have been less prone to marrying another man, let alone consider seriously dating another man.\n\nAssuming the truth of these answers (especially the answer to question #4) has helped me overcome the melancholic feeling that the movie and other similar true stories have left me with as well as stomach the ending. It did so by helping me realize that Sebastian and Mia, with their scintillating chemistry, could have been the one for each other under a different set of circumstances\u2026\n\n* Had they met toward the finish line of achieving their dreams of youth (instead of during a time where they were training for their race), they would have ended up together, still being able to spur each other on and inspire each other to achieve their dreams. \n\n* Had Mia's job been in LA (even if they still decided to end the relationship while working in the same city), they would've had a better chance of ending up together since Mia would need to look no further than Sebastian if her needs had changed while training and working as an actress). \n\n* Had Mia and Sebastian possessed a unifying theme from their dreams such as expressing themselves through art to the same demographic, or serving the needs of the same group or classification of people, they might have been willing to continue their relationship despite the time it might take away from their working towards achieving their dreams because spending time with each other indirectly or directly helps them achieve their dreams. \n\t\t\nThinking this way helped me not only empathize with the characters in the movie, but also pity them and their situation. Falling in love under the circumstances that the movie has established is so inevitable. Who wouldn't fall in love with a quirky and adorable character of Mia or a captivating and passionate character of Sebastian when you're facing hardships of a similar kind? Spending time together with a person like that also builds camaraderie which also doesn't help you refrain from falling in love with that person. At the same time, I now know that, if I were Sebastian, getting over Mia after the separation might've saved a devastating heart break - the kind I think Sebastian experienced at the end (I thought the lonesome-starting/ending single-note melodies of Sebastian's piano song at the end of the movie portrayed his heartbreak).\n\nAll of this goes to say that deciding to seriously date a person you might be attracted to might better work out (assuming the scintillating chemistry - one of Sebastian and Mia - is already there) if you guys...\n\n* have complimentary goals\n* are flexible or are planning to live near each other during each other's respective pursuits of dreams \n* think you have seen and found qualities in each other that would meet the unknowable changing needs of your future *(this applies only if facing geographical separation and maturely breaking up the relationship like Mia and Sebastian did in the movie)* \n\nThe presence of the third point will help you become less romantically distracted by other people, increasing the chance for each other keep each other's devoted love for each other until the next meeting. I believe these are the circumstantial qualities that will be a strong enough pull that would enable your inner Sebastian and your inner Mia to come together and stay together in marriage at the end.\n\nLet me know your thoughts!\n",

And the day Seb comes home and makes a dinner for Mia, he puts on jazz music (AS BACKGROUND MUSIC) and when they have their fight scene, the jazz music is in the background, but you dont notice it.

As someone who doesn\u2019t watch too many musicals there were a few things I really liked, they avoided the 2 minute dialogue that\u2019s purely setting up the song and devoted real time to not singing. The reoccurring songs are catchy as hell, that\u2019s the #1 quality for any musical. \n\nThe way they play with retro vs modern was amazing, credit to set design and directing. They managed to make a film about 2016 people that feels like the 50\u2019s, Gosling\u2019s brown suit and car, the Jazz club and some of the dresses look like they\u2019re from decades ago, but don\u2019t feel out of place in the quasi-retro world they created. Making it 100% in the 50\u2019s would have felt cheesy. \n\nGosling and Stone don\u2019t sound overly auto-tuned in their songs either, it\u2019s obvious they practiced and sang it by themselves, it\u2019s not pro-quality, but it\u2019s good enough. Very impressed with this director, only 32 and doing visionary films like this. \n",

The CinemaScope was a great touch, it looked and felt like old Hollywood, which was likely the point. I was extremely impressed with Stone and Gosling's performances, as well.

Whenever they come in it's always detaching from what could be mundane (traffic jam), trivial (deciding or not whether to have a night out, or the small talk when characters first meet) or vulnerable moments (Emma Stone's audition or Ryan Gosling questioning whether if the new relationship is a dream set to fail) of reality, or typical dialogue you would expect from a conventional movie. Even in the happiest moments of the film, the sheer joy of characters detach from reality while the film drifts into realistically impossible spectacles. I think the reason why the ending hit me so hard was that the film itself was a huge escapist delight until the piano finally sounds real and raw, and the dream of all of that which could have been finally crashes back down to earth. On a side note, the theme and question of whether the heartbreaking cost of dreams are worth it also seems pretty consistent with Whiplash.",

So I found the movie relatable, especially Emma Stone's shift from being unhappy, in an unsatisfying relationship, surrounded by social climbers who had no imagination or originality (e.g. they go to parties to meet the 'right' people, they all drive priuses), to being genuinely delighted when she is with Gosling.](#spoiler)\n\n[Her new romantic outlook is like living in a completely different world. One where she can dance freely and with great joy, as in that awesome scene at the jazz club. One where she relentlessly pursues her dreams, despite the rejections she has been facing at audition after audition. Everyone else in her world seem to fade away (and with good reason, as she was never actually close to or attached to them...they were just temporary placeholders in her life) but her inner world / soul is expanding more than it ever has.](#spoiler)\n\n[In the end, I think this was about Emma Stone's journey, or perhaps her jaunt, into the world of Gosling's romanticism. Before, she had been going down a prescribed path. She was dating someone good-looking and well-off but she didn't truly have feelings for him. She was going on auditions but her heart didn't seem to be truly in it, because all the rejection had caused her to be cynical and instead focus on 'playing the game,' as when she goes to a party with her friends to network and social climb. He brings her back to feelings she hasn't felt since she was a kid, when it was just her and her aunt making plays. He re-connects her with why she wants to be an actress, and she is inspired to produce a one-woman show.](#spoiler)\n\n[But Emma is not really a romantic person - perhaps she could become one, but she doesn't. When her one-woman show seems a failure, she is dejected, and makes the practical decision to move back home and try for a more lucrative career. Luckily she is made an incredible offer at the last minute, and ends up pursuing and fulfilling her dreams after all. That said, she never goes back to the romantic mindset. From that point on, she is practical and disciplined, which perhaps helps in her success. Still, in the end, I can't help feeling like it is Stone who missed out. Although she seems to have a good relationship with her husband, it's not the same caliber as she had with Gosling (not the same depth of feeling). Whereas Gosling may not be with another woman, but after the final scene in the movie I believe he will be able to let Stone go, and knowing Gosilng's character he will end up finding another woman  whom he can develop a deeply romantic relationship with (because he himself is a hopeless romantic, and his life is full of romance just by his mindset. Even without a woman in his life, his life is romantic).](#spoiler)",

Based on what we know about Mia, it can be presumed that the play is a reflection of her life (leaving home to pursue her passion for acting in Hollywood).\nGoing off of this, I believe that Mia turning off the lamp at the end of her play is symbolic of her doubts that she is meant to succeed as an actress, which foreshadows her move back home (note that Mia's interaction with the lamp is the only part of her play that we see in the movie).\n\nThe evidence to support this comes in the dream sequence, which imagines what might have happened between Mia and Sebastian, had their relationship worked out perfectly. It is in this perfect world, where Mia does not doubt herself, and her acting dreams. Therefore, the play she writes that is based on her life, is a play based on this perfect world.\n\nAnd it is in this perfect world, rather than turn the lamp off, Mia keeps it on.",

Eventually he had to have heard that she had gotten married and had a child, and had to accept that the reason she wasn't with him wasn't solely because of her career. She obviously still had time to make a family. I think this news would've broken his heart, and that he poured everything he had into Sebs to fill the void she had left. I feel like that's what Mia walked into when she went to Seb's that night. A Sebastian that never got any real closure. The club he had basically idd after her, because it was idd by her. Then that look they shared at the end of an awesome reminder of how we all imagine this paralel universe where everything went as we wished it to...I think on Mias end it was a \"sorry things couldn't work out I really loved you\" , and an acknowledgement on Sebastian's end that it still hurts but they both achieved what they set out to do and that he understands that. Reminds me of the end of the great Gatsby where it was so hopeful and hopeless at the very same time. So very layered. I understand how nuanced it is and appreciate it, but I still wish I could've gotten an happy ending here. But that's just the human part of me, and that's the beautiful thing about this film.",

Does this mean you were better or worked hard, no they just didn't get as lucky as you did.\n\nWhat this film represented (to me) was a big fuck you to hollywood actors who think it is just as simple as 'following your dreams' and condescendingly tell this to people all the time. No, there are millions of actors out there as talented as you, you just got very fucking lucky. you may have worked hard, yes. But so did every other aspiring actor out there.\n\nThis film fantastically represents those who maybe don't make it? Who don't get as lucky. It took a man as young as 32 to come up with this concept, when in reality it should have been talked about a long time ago. But no one in Hollywood would dare suggest they are there because of anything but their talent alone.\n\nIt represents sacrifice very very well also. Chazelle is one of the best directors int he world at this is only his second major film. He should absolutely swoop the awards this season. He seems to get people, and what frustrates people which will take him a long way. Just seems to \"Get it\", when he makes films.",

It never came across my mind again until I saw the trailer before Doctor Strange or Hacksaw (not sure which or if either), and wasn't left with any lasting impression- just brushed it off as another musical that wouldn't be any good. Looking back, though, I think it's a great trailer but I might be biased at this point.\n\nOn my way home last Friday, I walked past a theater and saw it was playing. I had nothing else to do so I bought a ticket and went in mostly blind but with high skepticism.\n\nEvery time I watch a movie that has garnered high praise, I expect too much and feel underwhelmed in the end. Not the case this time.\n\nI wish I was good enough with words to write a convincing review or to simply express how it made me feel in word form but the best I can say is: It fucked my shit up.\n\nI can't get over how much I love this film. I've set a goal to attend at least 30 screenings to persuade my hesitant friends to go see it and to prove to myself that I can't get sick of it. Just saw it for the third time and I don't think it's possible because so far, it gets better every time.",

Perhaps it is left to interpretation and that is fine but I have come across many interpretations that all don't feel 100% right. Would love to hear other thoughts.\n\n[1. **It's a pleasant \"La La Land\" scenario where everything would have happened with no hardships.** this is personally my favorite and also has many meta themes of the movie to support it. They were perfect for each other as a couple and their support of one another gave them the drive they needed to accomplish their dreams, but their love also would've been a ball and chain and would've held them back from accomplishing said dreams. We see this in the fantasy sequence in the end, where had they stayed together they would've ended up living an average life as the energy required to sustain the relationship would've been a professional hindrance.](#spoiler)\n\n[Personal fun thought: Sebastian explains the origin of Jazz as a form of communication between people who didn't speak the same language. How normally when you play Jazz it's a constant push and pull and chaotic series of choices from all the players in the band, a representation of life per say. After 5 years apart, Sebastian didn't have enough words, nor time, in the world to describe his complex feelings to Mia, so he expressed himself through Jazz, but via a song he plays alone without any compromise or chaos. It's the song/path/choices he wished he could have played without any problems or chaos.](#spoiler)\n\n[**2.  It's a vision of Seb's regret and how he would handle it if he could do it again.** Some sacrifices are needed to obtain ones goals. I think Seb is almost a tragic hero in a sense. He is pushed by Mia to pursue his dream which he finally decides to do our of his love for her, but he doesn't realize until the end that he would have been happier never reaching his goal and living with Mia instead.](#spoiler)\n\n[**3. It's a vision of what would have happened had they chosen to just stick together.** Seb would have played Jazz in Paris and opened his own club there, as shown in the vision. Mia would have become a successful actress and they would have both eventually achieved their dreams together.] (#spoiler)\n\n[**4. It's a vision of what they could have been, but the real world isn't like that and so it's just a pleasant dream scenario to ponder on.** This take is probably the most bittersweet of them all. The idea that this vision was something that never could have been a reality cause the real world doesn't work without hitches. It's a pleasant dream, but nothing more. It also has some merit in the smile they give to each other before leaving tho. A way of saying, that scenario could have never been but oh how wonderful it would have been in a perfect world. I'll always love you.](#spoiler)",

They are much better than the average person singing.\n\nIn the scenes...like the Audition scene - her voice is very vulnerable and delicate and that's absolutely intentional.\n\nthey sang \"live\" in the movie - a lot of singers singing live in a movie like this sound more flawed compared to singers in other movie musicals that do not do this (like the singers in Rent). this reminds me of the Les Miserables criticisms where the actors sang live - for a much more vulnerable feel.

I think that's why the audition cene was so important; beforehand, it basically stopped being a musical because Mia and Seb snapped back to reality where people can't just sing a song and make good things happen... except Mia then shows that's not true.

You can really tell that the person (or people) who made it really love/s music.\n\nI loved how the acting would be dramatic and theatrically over-the-too in some scenes, but naturalistic and understated in other scenes. I also was somewhat surprised at how few actually sung songs there were, but I thought the use of instrumental music (especially the main recurring piano theme) was beautiful. I particularly adored the final \"what if\" scene, and the way the editing suggests the characters \"feel\" those alternate lives through the piece of music they've shared together.\n\nGreat writing and acting, and the cinematography was sublime. Simply, extravagantly wonderful. 10/10",

I went into Umbrella of Cherbourg laughing and came out of theater crying.  Chazelle try to give us very similar experience to our audience and he delivers.  We need more films like this. No wonder why William Friedkin called him the future of American cinema.

This is the \"ideal\" life they would want to live together, but in reality it is not attainable.

Then it fades into the screens full ratio again and we see once again their \"ideal\" scenario.

Was Emma happy with her husband? Will Ryan be happy? Will he move on and find a partner?\n\nI liked Whiplash. I loved La La Land. Maybe because I saw the latter in theatre. Whiplash could have been better but that would be imposing my subjective thoughts of how it should be. Some sequences from whiplash are hard to forget. Visually it was good and now La La Land is stunning, stupendous, dazzling, WOW. Damien Chazelle is showing his range as a director  with this film. He has taken up a different genre than his last film and this one was a more ambitious project in terms of production and credit to the cast who pulled it off with ease otherwise it could have been a distaster, albeit a beautiful one at that. It will require a separate post to praise its technical bits. I think they part on good note, both are happy with what they have achieved with their career and passion. Doing what they loved instead of caring for people. It's ok they didn't end up together, but they both know and cherish the fact that whoever they are now have had a lot to do with the way they influenced and encouraged each other. It was more like platonic love than a traditional relationship. I wish Ryan had more opportunities to see Emma showcase her talent like he did ever so often. Maybe not because the movie was about the Jazz musician rather than the actress though he, Ryan assured Emma to go for it, when she felt she wasn't good enough, he was there to push her tell her that she will make it. \n\nLa La Land was worth it just for the visual music experience itself. Add to that the charming couple, the tension, drama and conflict in the middle. A complete package. Pure Art. I will watch it again but not really again and again because I am personally not into musicals but this was adapted beautifully to create its space in current cinema while staying true to the classic standards.\n\nI wonder how Miles Teller would have looked instead of Ryan Gosling as earlier planned?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

Damien Chazelle's sophomore debut masterfully found a perfect balance between being a romantic musical set in a warm fantasy land and a relatable tale about a realistic relationship in a cold, indifferent world.  \n\nGosling's and Stone's performances were grounded enough to continuously engage modern audiences while still being whimsical and charming enough to help gray out the line between a fictional story and a classical musical.  Several scenes, especially the budding love scene in the movie theater and the surprise dinner turned argument, left me feeling sentimental in a bittersweet way while I reminisced over my last relationship.\n\nThe cinematography was by far one of the best things about the film, and that's saying something considering how top-notch nearly every element was.  There were scenes that looked like they could have been pulled out of films by several popular directors on here, especially the Coen Brothers, Nicolas Winding Refn, and Woody Allen.  I was visually stimulated from start to finish.\n\nEvery song perfectly captured the energy of the moment it was in.  I love the that the tone changed several times - from optimistic to negative to optimistically warm to overly joyous to heartbroken to overly optimistic and then back down to a grounded sense of warm sadness or melancholic acceptance.  The song were also incredibly catchy, especially City of Stars.  Enjoy humming it for an entire week after seeing it.\n\nThe ending was perfect.  Our last glimpse at the relationship between Gosling and Stone closely mirrors that which existed between Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca.  The \"what if\" scene was so heartbreakingly beautiful that it nearly brought me to tears seeing how happy the characters could have been together despite it being impossible for them to have achieved what we were shown.  As sad as a lot of people were leaving the theater over the final state of the relationship, myself included, I still found some positive notes in what was left.  Both characters ended up staying true to themselves, and because of that they were able to achieve their \"pipe dreams\" and find a sense of happiness.  They'll probably always silently lament over what they had to lose - their relationship - to get to the places that they were in, but the smile they shared told me that they were okay with how it all ended up, even if both characters ended up shedding tears later on that night (something we can only guess one way or another).\n\nI don't really know how to wrap these things up, so just know that La La Land is without a doubt one of the best films of 2016.  It will undoubtedly go down as one of the strongest musicals of the past decade and will hopefully live on in the history of the cinema long from now.  ",

            "body": "Kind of late to this discussion, so not even sure if anyone will read this. But I walked away from this movie with such mixed emotions. Everything everyone said was true. The film was breathtaking, and one of the best movie going experiences Ive had in a long time. The music was amazing. The cinemtraophy was gorgeous. The chemistry between the two leads with so good. Purely as an experience, the film was truly something special.\n\nBut I walked away from the film feeling soured and depressed. And yeah, it has to do with the ending. The reason I feel so torn over it, is that I totally get that kind of ending is big point of the film. It's supposed to be a deconstruction of classic Hollywood Musicals (that were dreams and not a reality). \n\nI get that the point was to properly display Hollywood and how people chase dreams there (in that both of them had to sacrifice their relationship in order to achieve their dreams. And at least to them, it was worth going after their dreams - which is what most dreamers in LA do -- they give up everything for the dream).\n\nSo I get all that. Apart of it I suppose, is purely personal. I guess I'm a romantic, and the ending really hurt. I rarely see on screen performances where the two leads have actually believable chemistry. So that is what made the ending that much harder for me to swallow. Again, I get it - the point. But then apart of me wonders, if the film properly set this up in a way that it was earned?\n\nI guess I just don't understand why they couldn't still try to make it work. They ended up both back in LA. Gosling's character no longer took traveling jobs. It's clear by the end, Stone's character was still madly in love, and wished she had chosen her life with him instead. So why didn't they re-connect? \n\nAnd this is why I hate the \"time jump\" writing device. I feel like it deprives the audience of character development. It deprives us of a proper resolution, and understanding why they never made it work. I get your can say \"well that's just how real life is\". Or the simple answer is \"they had their dreams, and so they chose to pursue them instead\". But, the film never really sets up WHY they couldn't make it work.\n\nLike for instance, the entire plot where Gosling's character is touring with that famous band. The entire conflict is: Stone doesn't like him being away so often from here. And also she doesn't think Gosling's character even likes the music he's playing. She hates that he's given up on his original dream. Gosling is only taking the job, because he perceives that Stone's character (and her family) -- want a boyfriend that has a stable job and can provide.\n\nBut, Stone's characters tells him it's okay to NOT have that job. And she would rather he pursue his dream. SO THAT IS THE ENTIRE PLOT they have, that explains the conflict in their relationship. Well okay. But then Gosling decides to ditch that job, and go back to LA and work local jobs to save up money. So...why can't they be together, while they both pursue their dreams? Why is this preventing him from being with her again?\n\nIt just doesn't feel set up or earned IMO. ",

I cried so much, my lips puffed up and doubled in size like Angelina Jolie's, my green eyes became an abyss of vibrant emeralds and a headache with the beat of a pounding warhammer waged upon me (crying a lot gives me severe headaches).\nNot only did I cry for the protagonist's loss of their true love and the flashbacks of their romanticised and fantasiced \"what if,\" but also for that sensitive performance of Emma Stone during Mia's audition. The sadness in her voice, along with the story told, I was revelling in a torrent of tears as the song and its woe spoke to me deeply. \nIt made me feel. \nI felt and as I felt, I was living. As living is to feel and feeling is living. It reminded me I'm not dead inside, but I am ALIVE, not stone cold but alive with feeling and emotion. \n\nI am not one for musicals and I dislike soppy, corny love stories and romances. But for me, this film was done in a way that was neither soppy or corny. It was relateable and tasteful. None of those unnecessary rauncy, steamy window style, sandstorm, fuckstorm, fuck-me-hard-and-do-it-again scenes that makes you feel awkward when watching with other people such like family. It was simply implied in this film with more emphasis on the beauty of being in love, how magical it can make your plain world seem when you're arm in arm with that someone special. A tribute to how films used to be in the good ol' days (and no I am not old but 25), before movies became saturated with superficiality, lack of substance and depth with poor plot and story.\nSuch an elegant and emotive film. Beautiful, even despite the sad ending that'll haunt you like the ghost of your ex lover. Perhaps that's the genius of its beauty; The heartbreak you feel at the end.\n\nWatching the film, I now understand why it's titled \"LaLa Land\".... It wasn't their dream careers that were lala land, it was the prospect of being one another's dearest, forever.\nJust like a beautiful flower, the seasons changed and the winter came, \nAnd the beautiful flower was,\nNo more.\n\nI couldn't understand why Mia just couldn't wait for Seb. It was only a space of 5 years and she already got married and had a daughter, along with establishing herself a successful acting career, becoming the proclaimed actress she dreamt of from the beginning. Fuck, she didn't waste time. Is all that even possible in 5 years??\nAnd there's Seb, lingering behind, still stuck on her. \nI guess she never really forgave him enough for the harsh words he said to her when their relationship started to fray, to consider going back with him. She would've been better with him though, they were each other's true love, and he was talented and better looking than the old Colin Firth type she married.\n\n\n\nI wonder where you are,\nSomewhere distant and afar.\nDid my dream come true?\nThen why can't I find You?\nNowhere to be seen,\nOnly...when I \ndream.",

The upside is that at least everyone's obsessed with a movie that is actually great. \n\nI'm pretty sure it's gonna sweep the Oscars, too, whcih is fine. It deserves Best Musical Score for sure, and maybe even Best Song. I wouldn't object to it winning Best Cinematography either, even though I saw better throughout the year. La La Land was a terrifically photographed film. I'll be really upset if it wins Best Original Screenplay. The Lobster or The Nice Guys are much better choices.\n\nOverall though, great movie.

But, I don't think it tried to be \u2014 or even wanted to be perfect. You're allowed to like music \u2014 jazz \u2014 and not be a great dancer or singer. Heck, that's me: I love music, but have never been able to sing.\n\nThe movie is basically showing the common man/women's idea of jazz and music. Common \u2014 except for the stunning good looks of the actors \u2014 being average, not terrible, but average. Everyone assumes that musical needs to be performed by Broadway-trained actors. Why though? Why can't anyone sing; why can't anyone dance. Well, I think that's what this movie is about. ",

The story about Seb's passion and dream of keeping jazz alive seemed to symbolise exactly what this film was trying to be. A way to reinvigorate the musical film genre. \n\nI also thought the romance between Mia and Seb was a cruel but satisfying story about two lovers who had dreams and passions but sacrificed their love for each others dreams. Seb encouraging Mia to go after her goals no matter what was really beautiful. The way it ended was satisfying. This is because I thought they were going to get together at the end. The dream sequence emphasised this more and was the only real part i started hoping for the fairytale ending. Instead, however, they just left their romance where it was which I thought was satisfying that although they had captured their dreams they didn't have the fairytale ending. Which was really satisfying but I was routing for Seb and Mia to have that fairytale ending because who wouldn't. \n\nI thought the soundtrack and the piano tune motif that represented Mia and Seb's romance was really catchy. The singing was just right as it brought the whole film and musical score down to earth more than other musicals have done in the past. I also thought it was very positive and the acting and dancing, by no means perfect but really brought the story to life. \n\nHowever, my only proper gripe with the film was the rushed and could have explained what Seb was doing over the past 5 years. Rather than just explaining Mia's but even then it's not a massive plot hole because you can piece together his story from the band to getting the jazz club.\n\nOverall a really solid film even with its flaws. I would definitely watch it again",

I felt that moment was a clear climax and choice for those characters, but then it was muddled within the next two scenes.\n\nOverall, I felt La La Land was just mediocrity at its finest. It's the tale of two not very likable characters finding success but not each other.  There was nothing outstanding about the performances, writing, or music. Though, I thought it was filmed pretty beautifully and the costuming, while heavy handed, worked really well.\n\nThe love for this movie baffles me.",

The reality in that scene was that they both wanted to achieve their dreams and it all just kind of happened for them without the struggle, heartbreak, and persistence in the real world. It showed that they could have been together if achieving their dreams was easy and would just happen for them, but it made the point that if 2 people in love both want to achieve their dreams, the world is so hard and so unforgiving that if they want to make their dreams a reality, they will probably have to put love aside and do anything they can (like move to paris) to make it happen. When they do this, their individual desire to achieve their dreams will ultimately separate them and they will end up moving on from each other.\nIn a perfect world, they would each achieve their dreams effortlessly and get to spend their lifes together. In the real world, you have to make serious serious sacrifices in order to make your dreams reality, and that sacrfice may include a shot at true love. This montage at the end of the film was the true 'La La Land' that could never exist in the real world",

For those of you who love artistic direction and uniqueness, then this Chazelle film is for you. The on-screen charm of Gosling and Stone is unparalleled in film today.. and this movie once again vaults them into the elites of stardom. However, the real story is one of sacrifice and timing and the beauty of conflict and compromise as said in the film. The musicality of the film adds to the silent moments where you can feel emotion even without a lot of dialogue. This movie will win all the awards this year, and Chazelle has once again dazzled. ",

Obviously, younger and more contemporary viewers might find it hard to watch a new wave musical in another language, but fans of La La Land really need to check this movie out.\n\nAny doubt that it was directly inspired by this film should be squashed when Chazelle mentions it himself in the DP/30 interview on Youtube, or by the fact that his first film is idd after two of the characters in Umbrellas....or by the fact that most of the 3rd act is completely identical, minus the location.

With a Casablanca themed plot, modern and well known actors, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, deliver us a timeless story about love and destiny, resonating with today's generation as well as Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart's original fan club. The whole movie I was waiting for the catch phrase 'la la land' to be said, but I think the look Gosling and Stone exchange in the end says it all. Truly a 'la la land' fantasy for today's old souls.

Having heard all the critical acclaim it's receiving I held very high exception going in, only to find myself slightly underwhelmed. \nI love the musical elements in it and really appreciate the director's effort in rejuvenating musical in Hollywood. The songs are very well composed and performed and deserve everything praises they get. The choreography is highly enjoyable but it also leads to my first issue with the movie. When they are doing the dance sequence, sometimes the scenery is very close to how it looks in real life - but then it has people dancing in it. That just don't come together very well which took the audience away from the scene.\nAlso I don't find the script as well-written as many others do. It just didn't feel new or unexpected. I understand this is a movie trying to honor good old Hollywood classic, but struggling to chase after your dream only to find out you need to give away something important to achieve your goal is not really something we never heard before. \nI can think of many reasons to refute the above points, nevertheless these are still my honest feeling coming out of the theater. \n ",

The one that stumped me a bit was Winter. My interpretation is that Winter is a new beginning (even though many associate that with spring). In the film's case, Seb and Mia have new beginnings. Mia finally realizes her dream of being an actress and Seb opening his own bar(?) and keeping Jazz alive. It came at the cost of their relationship. The only way their dreams would be realized is if their relationship ended, but to both of them it was worth it because it's what they both wanted for each other to achieve. \n\nI hope I can get a discussion about Winter going because it's what really interested me. I thought it meant a new beginning. Everything's torn down/gone/empty. Mia has nothing. As a result, a new beginning happens with her casting. A new beginning is what I got. Obviously Summer was the height of their relationship, Fall was the downfall, Spring was when they had interest in each other and got together. What about Winter? What do you guys think.\n",

Some incredible long takes, the transition from film to musical that is interwoven shot to shot and within shots is flawless (because of its flaws) and the chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is second to none. Damien Chazelle is going from strength to strength as a director, from the Whiplash short, to Whiplash, to La La Land, they are some damn big stepping stones. Other positives include the whirlwind musical number at the ending with nods to Umbrellas, The Red Shoes, An American in Paris. This film made me smile and cry a lot.\n\nOn the down side, musically, it has two core themes that are strong (a love theme and a sad theme, basically) but not, like, Broadway strong. Others may get hooked, but they didn't really hook me. I did come away whistling with melancholy but I haven't wanted to rush out and listen to the songs again (unlike Sing Street, my favourite musical of the last year or so) with the exception of [Emma's monologue about Paris](#spoiler). It was refreshing to see a Hollywood musical akin to those I spent so much of my childhood adoring, but, again, I think it comes second to Hail, Caesar! as a love letter to Hollywood. Also, when broken down to the core story, [it is utterly predictable, as soon as they said \"You know I'll always be in love with you\" it was so obvious they wouldn't end up together. It is like saying \"I'll be right back\" in a slasher film. The screenplay rides on the coat-tails of subversive rom-coms like 500 Days Of Summer, Frances Ha (especially) and, also starring Emma and Ryan, Crazy Stupid Love.](#spoiler)\n\nAlso, and I have to mention it, the fact it is the whitest musical about historically black music ever. [It was dreadfully \"White guy saves jazz\"](#spoiler)\n\nI really really wanted to love this film, and I may end up loving it, warts and all, but I'll see it again in a few weeks and see if it still 'works' even once I know the ups and downs of the story.

I did however, need a believable one. I was not convinced at all by the demise of Mia and Sebastian's relationship. The implication is that their relationship collapsed after Mia found success as an actress, correct? It's certainly conceivable that many relationships would suffer this fate - but why did it happen to these two people in particular? For the most part, the two were very supportive of one another's creative endeavors, and at no point did either of them seem overly needy or clingy. Why exactly then, did their relationship not withstand her success? This probably would have been more convincing to me had Chazelle done more to build up the downfall of their relationship prior to the five year jump. I mean, they had ONE fight, which for the most part they both seemed to get over rather quickly once Seb told her about the audition, and all of a sudden Mia is asking \"where are we\"? Huh?](#spoiler)\n\n[The five year jump struck me as lazy writing and and an easy way to get a tear-jerker ending, but without a proper explanation as to how we got there. Though my friend thought it was meant to be left to our interpretation as to what had happened, I could buy that if the rest of the film hadn't been so on-the-nose about absolutely everything else. Who even WAS this guy that Mia was with? Where did he come from? Why was he a more viable option than Seb?It would have been way too OTT for the film to have both characters achieve their dreams AND live happily ever after, but I would have preferred either: Chazelle to fill in the gaps on why they broke up, or have them end up together, but neither of them fulfill their dreams and perhaps that is what bonds them together. I also didn't buy Mia suddenly hitting it big as there was no indication that she was an amazing acting talent and the majority of actors DO NOT make it. Every single film about actors always ends with them making it and this film was so authentic in so many other ways that I was hopeful that it wouldn't go in the obvious direction, but alas. Anyway, rant over, I did enjoy this film a lot and got very caught up in the story and characters, which is why the ending is frustrating me so much.](#spoiler)",

Maybe that's because i went into it not expecting much.\n\nTo the people who don't think it really deserves 14 nominations, I actually agree. That said, seeing La La Land was absolutely the best time I've had at the movies in the past 5 years. It also really reminded me of 500 days of summer, which I also really liked.\n\nI loved the cinematography and the wide shots. It was so old school, and yet it looked so fresh and interesting. I can't stand the way modern film involves constant close-up shots of people's expressions. It feels like I'm invading their personal space when the camera gets shoved in someone's mug. Also the music was good, and the movie had just the perfect amount of it. Not too much singing and dancing, not too little, just enough. And I liked that Emma and Ryan aren't amazing singers or dancers. It makes them human. It makes the movie relate able, because I'm also a shitty singer and dancer. It felt like what a musical would actually look and sound like if it happened in real life.\n\nI also think I liked La La Land because on some level I can relate to it. A few years ago I was dating the girl of my dreams. I was crazy about her, she was beautiful, we had amazing chemistry, and I was convinced I was going to marry her. But in the end, it didn't work out and we broke up. And now she's engaged to some other guy. There is a gut wrenching reality to the movie that perfectly captures what it feels like to be in love and then to lose it. Hits you right in the feels, man. But it also makes you feel so alive and there is a sort of bittersweet feeling when you look back at what was and what could have been. La La Land captures that perfectly.",

For one thing, the music, the dancing, the colours, the set and costume design, the acting, and the chemistry between Gosling and Stone was all pretty perfect. On the other, a lot of the movie felt like it was being told in montages, and by the fourth montage I found myself getting kind of irritated. Also, and I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but the ending left me feeling depressed and empty, which may be the point, but it was just very very sad to me. Also, the film felt a bit unbalanced to me, and I thought the pacing was a bit off, but maybe that was just me.\n\nHowever, there were some moments in the film that I'll never forget, like Emma Stone walking through the party when everyone else is in slow motion, and when she sings the story toward the end when she's at the audition, and the final ending montage that shows what it would've been like if Emma and Ryan had a happily ever after ending, those were stunning moments that literally made my jaw drop. And of course Ryan Gosling did a phenomenal job, he really let a lot of emotion show in his eyes and he was fantastic. \n\nI don't know, maybe I need to watch this movie again to get a better feel of it. I really feel like giving it a ten because of how emotionally powerful the movie was and because of how much the movie was so perfect in terms of cinematography and the like, but I'm just not sure if I really loved the movie all that much, especially because I just can't get over how annoyed the constant montages left me, but I still feel like this is one of the best movies I've seen all year. I don't know, maybe I'll go see it again, I most definitely recommend this movie to everyone, but it's just, for me, a hard film to digest.",

Hollywood may not be cranking out musicals at the same rate as it once did, but it certainly hasn't stopped - and just because they look and feel different doesn't mean they lost something.  They just evolved with a culture that evolved.\n\nSo La La Land steps in to rescue us from *Chicago*, *Les Mis*, *Moulin Rouge* - here's some classic, Gene Kelly era musical flavors for you!  Which I guess I'd be fine with - but even Gene Kelly's movies were about *more* than music, song, and dance.  *La La Land* offers little more than nostalgia, beautiful cinematography, and some impressive dance sequences.\n\nCase in point - when Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone start to float in the Griffith planetarium, I didn't *feel* anything because it didn't mean much.  It was just beautiful, pretty, nostalgic - for us to smile, and go, \"Oh yeah, like those old musicals.\"",

I hate Moulin Rouge. I hate every Andrew Lloyd Webber musical out there. I also hate Les Miserables. Also, Fuck Frozen. Everything except Hamilton and Evil Dead has been nothing but cringe IMO. But La La Land is something different. Instead of taking cues from other English musicals, it takes inspiration from two French musicals: The Pretty Girls of Rochefort and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, and in turn used them to create a tragic tale of fame and fortune. \n\nAlso, the musical composition is great. It uses cues from traditional jazz, several modern jazztronica and the rest of it is based on the influence of Michel Legrand (who composed both The Pretty Girls of Rochefort and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg). It's rare for American musicals to take influences from Legrand, but Damien Chazelle and Jake Hurwitz did it in a way that pays tribute to Legrand's work in a beautiful way.\n\nOverall, La La Land is hopefully the way how musicals should be made. It should be more operatic, with more emphasis on character creating music than music creating character. Everyone should go watch it. Fuck Moulin Rouge.",

Their chance meetings, and the budding romance in \"Spring\"  were nice, sure, but it didn't feel like anything was really happening. To be clear, I understand that the first hour is extremely important to the film, as it just overwhelms you with optimism and hope, sets up the character arcs, and tries to get you to like the characters. The groundwork laid in the first hour really comes through in the end, when you see the journey they've been on, it adds to the emotions. There's nothing wrong with it; like the rest of the movie, it's beautiful, well-written, and well-acted. I can't explain why, but it just felt like it was missing something.  \n\nFinal takeaway: My god, is Damien Chazelle talented. Whiplash is probably my favorite film of the last five years, and to follow that up with this? Really exciting young talent.",

However it doesn't really work like that in the movie because the best decision that both the characters make to follow their dreams happen because of their love for on another, Sebastian pushes her to write the play that gets her discovered, Mia gives the Jazz club it's id, their unconditional love and support for each other encourages them to be better(even in the case of Sebastian's detour with The Messengers which he undergoes to live up to his expectations as a man for Mia). I'm not getting how them separating from one another is suppose to be the best decision for them but this is a failure of the movie for me in not developing the conflict that the movie is supposedly centered around until the last 26 minutes of the film.\n\nInstead of meandering around for the first hour and half I would have preferred the movie developed the characters more and had a relationship for me to get invested in the from the get go so the stakes of Mia leaving felt more concrete and real. I can believe that both the characters in this film are in love without the need for an over the top perfect love story.\n\nI'm disappointed in Chazelle because as someone who's had to make the same decision between following a dream or choosing love, Chazelle glosses over the details that would have brought this story to life for me.",

We felt the casting could've been better and neither lead had the stage presence or singing voice needed for a musical film. I felt it was REALLY evident how inexperienced Stone was when she did the \"getting ready for a night out\" routine with her friends at the beginning. When they move out into the street, she even bumps into one of the other women.\n\nThe storyline was pretty standard and I felt like I'd seen the film 100 times before. I was glad to see a modern musical though, feels like it's been a while. None of the music grabbed me, though the songs were well written. I liked their piano duet in his apartment about halfway through the film, they sounded great together when they weren't overwhelmed by the music.\n\nI found their fight kinda dumb. He is living in a shitty apartment and she wonders why he won't give up a job that pays $1000 a week? I get that he was selling out and all but, hello, that's how he saves up to build the bar he wanted? I don't know why they just didn't point out how much she was risking by doing her one woman play. She did end up saying she couldn't even pay back the theatre but it felt skimmed over that they needed all the money they could get so shaming him for not giving up the band was kind of annoying. But I guess it's the whole \"the next chance you take could be your next big break\" mentality. \n\nI liked that they didn't end up together and I really dug the \"what if\" scenario, mainly because it shows that they had to go through what they did just to get to that point of professional achievement, and even if the relationship aspect didn't work, their meeting each other helped guide them to that point. Not every relationship you have is your happily ever after and sometimes people just help you get from one stage of your life to the next. If they had stayed together and followed the same path with no obstacles, they'd end up in someone *else's* bar, someone else's dream. \n\nThis was the most interesting aspect of the film, it should've been explored more.

Both Gosling and Stone were great in their acting but singing? Not so much. The parts that should be musical numbers are just acted out. Which, yes, it's a movie, they should be acted out, but the point of the musical is to use song to express inner thoughts or feelings. I learned next to nothing about the characters from the songs, and felt the movie would have been stronger without the singing. \n\nThe story managed to take the \"pursuit of passion\" theme and revamp it, giving us something a little different from a movie like Whiplash, but I had a hard time relating to either Stone and Gosling. I didn't seem to know enough about the characters outside of their relationship to each other to get a really good feel them. And without that, the relationship of Teller/Simmons in Whiplash told a stronger story to me. \n\nThe cinematography was great, but I've seen a lot of that before. Nothing was really new. \n\nFor me the saving grace, asides the acting, was the soundtrack. The orchestration acted as a third lead to this movie in it's weight and impact. Birdman managed to do that with the drumset playing in the background, and if La La had gone more that route, rather than attempted a musical, it would have hit home better for me. ",

It's also hard not to bring a little bit of cynicism to movies these days as we're constantly being bombarded with films that like to poke fun at itself and movies in general.\n\nLa La Land is a love letter to movies and musicals and refuses to be cynical just for the sake of it. Even after enjoying films with smart twists, awe inspiring moments and visuals, and great direction it's rare to come by a movie that puts its absolute heart and soul on display for the audience to see. \n\nWhether you move to a new city, spend a blissful week at a summer camp, or even have the best new year's eve of your life, there's a moment of melancholy where you know that the excitement must eventually come to an end but when you look back at the moments you were thankful that you got to experience them (if only for a while). Watching this film reinvigorated that energy of just being happy without having to be smart, cynical, or profound (even though La La Land manages to be all of those things to some degree or another).\n\nFor me La La Land summed up in one word is 'Happy'. Being cynical or sad happens way too often in life and to be able to experience something without having to worry about how you might look to others or how others may look to you is a feeling that really should be treasured. This is about as Disney a film can get without being Disney.\n\nSo in short: Watch La La Land. Experience it. Love it. ",

The music, while simplistic, was enchanting, but those lyrics felt stale and uninspired at just about every turn. \"A Lovely Night\" is by far the best number, and the closest to what I imagined Chazelle was trying to homage from older musicals. But the entire first act felt like it dragged, the opening number -- while technically impressive -- was irritating and mediocre. It felt hammy in the worst sort of way, the meta sort of we-know-this-is-a-musical-lets-rub-it-in way that began to grate pretty quickly. Gosling and Stone turn in decent performances but Oscars? Really? Aside from some nods for visuals and the inevitable Original Song nomination, this really does not deserve the gold.

I get it that we don't know what happened in that five years, but it just feels like these two characters really complemented each other, it's not like one of those movies where we can tell the characters are just not going to be in each other's lives in the future.

I wonder if he will ever know he is only her husband because she couldn't be with Seb. I don't like stories or real life where one person seems to or claims to have met their \"true love\" but for some reason couldn't be with them so they move on and select another partner. That seems like a raw deal to the new guy. Shouldn't he be able to meet his own true love? \n\nI didn't like how Mia treated her first boyfriend either. Dating for a month, she is meeting his brother - clearly he thought it was more a committed relationship. When she planned a date with Seb while still technically dating the first guy, that is sketchy behavior, and then to just leave saying \"I'm sorry\"........why not break up first? \n\nI didn't understand why Seb couldn't just go to Paris with Mia. He could play \"real\" jazz in a Parisian club, save his money and if Mia becomes a hit, she could help him open a club = they both get their dreams and both get what they want. \n\nThe only way it makes sense to me is that they truly were not in love. They were merely lost/discouraged people who found support in each other, became friends, had some physical tension/infatuation - helped each other but ultimately didn't love each other, just cared about each other as friends. \n\nInfatuation/lust is easy to come by, friendship is a little harder, but true love is exceptionally rare and when it comes you just don't ignore it. And if you find it and let it go - I don't think its fair to move on to someone else, the new person is never going to live up to the mythology of the \"true love\" and subconsciously there will be tension which leads to affairs, divorces, etc. \n\nI think the music was fantastic - though they aren't great singers, that makes it more endearing. I thought the opening number was too long and could really be taken out of the movie altogether and it would be better. ",

The cinematography and the acting of Gosling and Stone were both exceptional. However, everything else about this movie upset me to my core.\n\nThe movie was excessive emptiness, and this was not by design. Stone somehow managed to make something of a character that had almost zero character development beside following a dream and being somewhat quirky. She is an aspiring actress that has been dreaming of becoming famous since she watched a couple of movies with her aunt. She doesn't care about what she's in, she just wants to be a part of the show. Even when she pursues her dream in a more ambitious fashion but writing and starring in her own one-woman play we see literally nothing about what is involved with the show. \n\nConversely, Gosling is a \"true-musician\", in the sense that being uber-pretentious about what Jazz should be makes you a better artist. At the beginning of the film we see Gosling refuse to play a whole set of Christmas Carols for JK Simmons because he is artistically above such a fate. While, these may be understandable, it loses merit a couple of scenes later when he is playing in a 80's cover band with only minor disdain. \n\nAs the relationship between the two begins to form through an occasional quip from Stone and Gosling's overtly broodingly sexuality the emptiness of the movie has pushed the plot far beyond a redeemable point.

Right from that first scene, when everyone on the highway gets out of their car and starts dancing and singing, and they're all smiling, and there are guys doing tricks on BMX bikes, and people of varied ethnic backgrounds doing different types of dances, I had a really bad feeling about the movie.\n\nIt wants so badly to be an old Hollywood musical, and it goes about this by just mimicking them, without capturing any of the charm. The musical numbers never feel organic or even necessary - they just happen when they do, because that's what's supposed to happen in musicals. They rarely advance the plot, so they're self-indulgent in that respect. The musical number with the LA skyline was particularly bad - it's about how they're starting to fall for each other, but they literally had just met. It wasn't at all earned, and all I could see were Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone going through the motions, doing a dance routine from an old Fred Astaire film. \n\nI also found it really smug, self-absorbed and condescending. First of all, I'm sick of the self-congratulation surrounding artists and \"dreamers.\" Its great when people follow their dreams, but that pretentious \"here's to the dreamers\" song was sickening. Secondly, the condescension aimed at popular culture (e.g. pop music) was off-putting and smarmy. ",

Loved the scene of them tap dancing in the moonlight and the later scene of them dancing in the observatory.\n\nMy criticism for it though is that it felt like it could have been better paced, it sort of jumped around a lot throughout to get to where it wanted to go without explaining much. Like I mentioned before the songs were pretty flat even coming right from the movies I can barely remember them. And I'm a sucker for a good story and although everything surrounding the story was well done the story itself left a lot to be desired. Watching it though I get the impression that Chazelle based this movie around the ending number, he probably knew that is what he wanted the story to be about but and he just needed to get it to that point.\n\nI've seen most of the major 'best picture' player movies this year in Moonlight, Manchester By the Sea, and now La La Land. Of them I would say La La Land definitely deserves the award. The reason I think that is because as a finished project La La Land was the most captivating and was such a spectacle. The stories and acting in Moonlight and Manchester By the Sea I thought were fairly better but La La Land was just something else.",

            "body": "My thoughts on La La Land. The inner critic is always there. Of course. I don't know if any artist can observe his or her field of expertise with an eye of a pedestrian. To bring that magic back into your system would be great and a lot of mediocre movies would benefit from that. And that's the task of a director. Damien Chazelle gets his job done masterfully and some scenes I personally find genius. \nNow let's be honest, the opening scene, like Mr. Chazelle said himself, could stay on the cutting room floor. Yes it's a great set-up, yes you're trying to prove me that you care about diversity, but that song just doesn't take you on the journey, doesn't match that same level of fascination that some of my favorite Broadway musicals like In The Heights and Memphis do with their opening numbers after which you want to sing your neighbors ears off. \"Another Day of Sun\" just doesn't do that trick to you. So as \"Someone in the Crowd\". Two possible wrongs with this one: a) Linus Sandgren didn't manage to catch the choreography of the 4 girlfriends; b) the choreographer didn't activate the narrow space of LA apartment in that scene. We're moving on, and the inner critic sits and keeps watching it with his arms folded. Here comes the beautiful sunrise scene and suddenly you start feeling warmth but still not sold on the \"not-quite-gene-kelly\" Gosling's tap-dancing. But you can't just sit still watching those two actors effortlessly do magic in front of your eyes during those long takes. You give in and Mr. Chazelle marvelously controls your every step from now on until the end credits roll. Justin Hurwitz has a big-phat chance to get on the list of musical greatest melodies. His leitmotif grabs you by your ears at the club when the two meet, leads you through that rollercoaster what we artists call life, makes you feel happy for them, sad for them, and then nostalgic the day after and then the day after that. Very curious to look at this composer's achievements in ten years. \nEmma Stone's audition song I think is what an actor's manifesto should be. And I'm saying it to myself it's what I should be. Should the door close, the lights go down and you stand there and tell non-other's but your story. Powerful moment that brings both the actress and the director big big credit. \nAnd finally, the \"would-be\" scene. Chazelle takes the challenge by taking my hand and leading me through the entire it-could-be-that moment when with Emma Stone we fantasize the world she will never live in, the part of life she will never experience. La La Land is definitely the highlight of the year for me and gives me so much hope and reassurance in what I've chosen to do. If you want to become sentimental for some time again and soak your heart in the world of wonderful music, touching story and skillfully crafted dialogue, go see that movie. If you're outside of the entertainment industry, definitely go see the movie. \n8 out of 10. \nPeace out. Thanks for reading.",

I found myself forgetting what their characters' ids were halfway through the movie. If you asked me to hum a tune from the song right after it was over, I could not have. I felt that as a musical it was weak. The first 30 minutes had the typical theatrical musical numbers that you would expect, but after that, it was just musicians playing music in a regular stage setting like they would in any movie. That made the rest of the movie strange for me, because I kept waiting for someone to break out into song but it never happened. I also think Ryan and Emma's acting was great, but if you're going to cast two stars as the main characters in a movie marketed as a musical, get people who are actual singers. Both of them are not strong in that department and it kind of ruined the effect for me when the girl in the car in the very opening scene was the best singer in the movie and we never saw her again. It's not that I think they were bad, the other singers just had stronger voices. For those of you that hate musicals and liked this movie because it lacked those things, I hear you. I just felt that overall it made the movie seem kind of indecisive. \n\nThis is not to say that I think it was bad. I just think that without the cinematography and high-profile main actors, it could have just as easily been a Disney movie. I love Disney movies. I probably watch more of those than any other, so I'm not even afraid to say that it probably could have been better as a Disney movie. It's a great concept, but the whole thing just seemed messy, because it wasn't consistent with its themes.

It wasn't really what I expected - especially after the first 30 minutes, which have several dance numbers, showtunes, and musical breaks like a classic musical.  The movie doesn't keep up this pace, and begins to sag really badly in the middle once they've gotten together - the only musical interlude for awhile is John Legend's shitty band playing music shittily, which we're supposed to think is shitty but still the movie plays it out for the whole song.\n\nUltimately I think the film focuses *too much* on Stone, Gosling, and their romance.  Other classic musicals about love usually had several other plots going on, or narrative forces keeping them apart (I'm married/family hates me/whatever) which then makes the romantic, dancing-in-the-stars musical numbers especially moving - they're dreams of what could be, passion exploding after being held back.\n\nFor Stone and Gosling, there's nothing holding them back - it's only in the last sequence of the movie do we approach some narrative pressures keeping them apart, and we feel the longing between them.\n\nI don't know - I like the idea of it, but it just didn't deliver much.  It's especially disappointing after a stellar opening bit.",

I can't remember anything about the opening number, though.  And giving J.K. Simmons a non-singing cameo was a pretty big mistake.

            "body": "On its April 18, 2016 episode, a podcast called *Soul Music* by BBC Radio 4 discusses the song \"The Way You Look Tonight\" in a lovely way.  Utterly appropriately, the song was written by Jerome Kerns and Dorothy Fields for a Fred Astaire - Ginger Rodgers 1936 movie called *Swing Time* - and won an Oscar.  I think this podcast and song make a fitting coda to *La La Land*, including when the podcast talks about the line, \"Yes you're lovely - never, ever change,\" specifically, about how the line acknowledges the transience of a shared love and moment in time the singer wishes to preserve but knows will pass.  All the singer - all that any of us - has is the option to remember or bury the memory of that love and moment.  We can control *how* those things impact us but much less *whether* they do.\n\nCAREFUL! This podcast episode might devastate you all over again, but if you can stand the tugs at your heart - and if you survived *La La Land* then you can - you will be glad you listened. :D",

In general, I think some of the best movies of the past few years are great because of how \"real\" they can get (my favorites from this year are Fences and Moonlight), and there were no specific personality traits of Seb or Mia that they couldn't find from other people, so it wasn't a huge tragedy to me when she ended up with someone else.\n\nAlso, the music was good, but not as good as it could be. Ryan Gosling definitely was not the best singer they could have gotten in all of LA, and he was definitely cast on star power. It just felt lazy that all the songs were wonderful and it was this homage to great musicals, and fronting this was a mediocre voice. While Emma Stone also wasn't perfect, I thought her raspy voice suited her character.\n\nI enjoyed the movie, since it was a well-done musical, but I don't think it had the best screenplay or dramatic performances of the year, nor do I think it ranks among the great musicals.",

Plus, even though it shows two struggling artists, it doesn't portray them that realistically - you could never support yourself on just a job as a barista, worst, you could never afford an apartment that large on just a job as a lowly barista. It was a little more true to Sebastian's economical life, but the characters that seemed most genuine to the real world are still the idless folk that open the movie.\n\nBut taken completely in fantasy, it's a fun ride. Their singing/dancing isn't up to par with those from Demy's, Donen's, or Minnelli's films so the over-praise is a bit odd, but the numbers play otherwise well into their style. Whenever they're not singing/dancing, this film deflates into an GLEE style plot, almost going through the motions of what an artist struggles through. Cinemasins will enjoy this one.\n\nThe last 20 minutes are pretty special (mostly because the big fantasy number is dialogue-free). Beautiful work, good \"message\" about happiness and success, even though it was wholly expected and a bit trite.",

Some of it reminds me of the hauntingly beautiful song by Sara Barielles 'She Used to Be Mine.' Overall perfect film. I needed a feel good film and it delivered.

Perhaps I'm too much of a jazz traditionalist, and I was hoping that with the fantastic jazz music that Damien Chazelle fused into Whiplash and with jazz taking center stage in this movie, it would have been spectacular.  But honestly I don't remember a single melody from the film.  The opening sequence was cool to see, and \"Another Day of Sun\" is an appropriately brisk song for what they were doing, but I don't have any desire to listen to it again.  I can't help but think that if 10 films were made this year, with all of them taking a stab at making a jazz-themed musical hearkening back to the older days of cinema, this would have been one of the more forgettable ones.  It's great because there's nothing to compare it to, really.  But I will grant that it was buoyed by a good story, a brilliant ending, and great performances from Emma Stone and that guy that women seem to find attractive.",

I know this was kind of the point but there was a little too much taken from Golden Age Hollywood for me to be blown away by it's originality. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were fantastic as always,but one of my biggest problems with this movie is THEY BARELY FUCKING UTILIZED J.K. SIMMONS. Really Damien Chazelle? J.K. Simmons won you an Oscar for Whiplash but you give the man 3 goddamn lines? And I know, he doesn't have to and wasn't trying to make another Whiplash, but did Damien Chazelle need to bring in the man to give him a dog shit role? Other than that, there was dope cinematography and visuals, but the camerawork and lighting was pretty amateurish in some scenes IMO. Lastly, I don't understand why so many people are in love with this movie because I did not understand the point of the final dream sequence. I thought the whole point of the film was to show that they couldn't be together AND follow their dreams, so why was this sequence showing what could have been? Now I know that scene was a fantasy of the two main characters off in la la land(roll credits), but to me it just felt emotionally manipulative as if the director was rubbing salt in the wound and that everything could have worked out but it just didn't.",

It is a perfect oscar-bait, LA masturbation - but you can't hate it.\nI am not a musical fan - this is a form of art that is as far away from my background and culture as possible. Musicals are difficult to produce - they have huge effort/effect ratio and I always feel that it is just too many things on the screen. I always experience two separate things - the songs and the story. What I received yesterday is an almost decent romance movie with good music in the terrible, tacky setting of LA.\n\nI will start with the bad things: too much blur, singing and dancing by stone/gosling could've been better.\nThe rest was good: I liked the acting, the outfits, the music and the ending.\n\nOn the scale 0-10: 6,5 - worth watching in a spare time, a decent example of it's genre",

Before tonight there had only been 2 films this year that I had LOVED with those being The Witch and Nocturnal Animals. Well now I can safely say that that number has been bumped up to 3 after my viewing of the exhilarating, electrifying, entertaining and euphoric La La Land. I'm just going to break it down simply, the editing is perfect, the cinematography is perfect, the direction is perfect, to say the score is perfect is an understatement, the performances are perfect, the production design is perfect, everything about this film is executed so flawlessly it is truly difficult to comprehend that the director, Damien Chazelle, is only 31 and his 2nd directed feature is one of the best films of the decade. La La Land needs to be seen by everyone no matter how casual or cinephilic you are as it caters to both.",

In particular, I really found Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's singing and dancing to be underwhelming. They're not bad, just unimpressive. Ryan Gosling in particular is incomprehensible during the few times that we hear him singing. The \"A Lovely Night\" song and dance routine (the one that's used in all the posters and promotional material for the film) really felt like amateur hour.\n\nThankfully they don't sing too often in the film, and the most memorable musical moments either don't feature them at all (the opening) or don't require them to sing (like the Griffith Observatory scene and of course, that beautiful ending).\n\nJust my two cents. I go into more detail in my [full review here](https://adrianwatchesthings.wordpress.com/2017/01/11/la-la-land/) if anyone's interested. ",

The performances were solid be I feel the film was carried by the fact that I was familiar with the main characters (not only in fact that I've seen Ryan and Emma act before but acting as a couple before). So for this the relationship seems a bit rushed,  they seem to go from just dating to long term(not sure how long term the time line gets fuzzy there) relationship v fast. (this may just be a romantic film trope). \nThe final ending of them not getting back together was solid, but the main point that I can't get past is why Mia wasn't more aware that a jazz club at that location wasn't most likely his.  She didn't really seem to react when her husband asked to 'check out this place'. A building that she knew Sebastian and pretty much only Sebastian wanted to turn into a jazz club. This was also a scene only really for Mia as Sebastian knew she had become successful (she was on the poster on the club wall). \n\nOverall it was pretty good but lack that lower level substance, but does have some plot holes.

I put all my heart and soul/blood and sweat into making my short grad film. I was ambitious and naive. The runtime guidelines of the project was supposed to be 10 mins but mine was 22 mins. I refused to cut it down, because I believed that the slow nature was essential to the story, that many shots/scenes were brilliant, and that people have too much ADD nowadays so they should just have patience. Now I look back and see I was foolish. I believe the director suffers from the same. Many shots/scenes are held wayyyy too long, with the one continuous shot. He's saying fuck you ADD people with no patience, fuck you fast cutting hollywood mainstream movies, and fuck yes I'm a director prodigy so it's totally justified. The movie would've been better if many of the shots were cut down instead of lingering for no reason but to seem profound and artistic/foreign (think Bella tarr).\n\n2. **Too self conscious in its rejection of the fast, cgi filled Hollywood blockbuster landscape.** He definitely is strongly influenced by non cgi embracing directors like spike Jonze and Michel gondry. However I feel the look of the movie is somewhat blah in many cases. The director wanted to go for, artistic, portrait like, stripped down, a unique look - especially for many of the outdoor daylight scenes (not the heavily, color lit night scenes). Many of the outdoor daylight seems just seemed lazy, not well shot like a student film. It's like he was like fuck lighting, we're gonna make this raw and real, let's just use a camera and shoot. I see what he is going for in his aesthetic, but his conscious lack of technical effort is a bit dumb. He's basically saying I'm so talented, creative and unique that I don't have to make this look good like the rest of Hollywood does. I'm gonna disregard many cinematography mainstays and go experimental because I'm an Ivy League prodigy.\n\nJust looked up his dp and it's some dude from Sweden. Figures...\n\nAnd that opening scene was totally unnecessary and basically the director jerking off. It was basically a target/gap commercial directed by spike jonze/Michel gondry. Except it was not lit and much of the time the people's faces are in darkness (because dynamic range Isn't possible without controlled lighting) because they're shooting in a totally like free form environment dude! Oh wow, and there's a band in the back of that cube truck! How cute, creative and kitschy like a Matt and Kim music video.",

I THINK they mentioned it in the movie but I'm not 100% positive. \n\nSo at the end it started with Ryan playing a few notes of the song which reminded him of Emma and as he was \"playing\" the movie we were watching was his inner story going \"oh man, I should have done it this way and did this differently and we might actually be together today.\" \n\nThen the fantasy comes up to the present where he's finishing his song and it's back in reality. \n\nBut anyways that's just my take on it :0)",

He mentioned that this was his passion project and damn well shows.\n\nNot to diminish your point there, but it was Whiplash that *compelled* them to take that risk.

(Even La La Land mocks the idea.) BUT the movie was FULL of \"happily ever after\" events. The barista gets discovered and becomes a huge star. That doesn't happen in real life! That's silly. And grumpy losers don't get invited into popular bands. Haha. I mean there's a scene of dancing in outer space for crying out loud. There's already so much happiness and silliness and rule bending in the movie, a \"happily ever after\" ending would've worked fine.\n\nHaving a bittersweet ending in an otherwise joyous movie for no reason other than \"a happy ending would be silly\" is... a little bit dissonant to me.\n\nThe bittersweet ending of Casablanca works so much better because it had to be that way. Rick couldn't get with the women he loves because she was married (and the dude was a great guy), and as a couple they were so important to the war effort. In La La Land, it's like they couldn't be together.... because??? It's not even like the excuse was that Mia was too busy for a relationship (she ended up getting married anyway) or that Ryan Gosling's character had something to do that would prevent him from being in a relationship (he just played a piano lol). And it's not like they fell out of love or anything either.\n\nI thought the ending was very well done, but personally would've enjoyed a happy ending more.

I think both characters achieved exactly what they wanted at the beginning of the film and that is a beautiful thing.  \n\nI think that it's a wonderfully happy ending in spite of the fact they didn't end up together.  Both characters seem undeniably happy in the end, even if they were overcome with some strange \"what could have been\" emotions when they briefly cross paths after all that time.  \n\nThen again, maybe I'm jaded and resonates with me because I went through the same thing last year.  I ended a relationship because we were ambitious and one's dream would have suffered more than the other's to make the relationship a success.  People are not a goal in life.  ",

Sebastian explains the origin of Jazz as a form of communication between people who didn't speak the same language. After 5 years apart, Sebastian didn't have enough words (nor time) in the world to describe his complex feelings to Mia, so he expressed himself through Jazz, sort of a secret language (which he taught her) that only she could fully comprehend at that time.\n\n2. The 'alternate reality' sequence (which felt very much like the 'reality vs imagination' scene in 500 days of summer) was over the top Hollywood on purpose. Sebastian might be saying: \"Mia, I wish our lives could unravel like the movies you're so in love with, but reality is much different, and that's ok. We'll always have what we had\". It also felt like the director's love letter to old Hollywood. Both these elements echo back to the \"I'll always love you\" from the prior scene.\n\nI'm sure there's a bunch of other references, like an homage to Casablanca, etc. But those 2 stood out to me the most.

And to have all those emotions at once was great. I think the way they set that up was so, so good. \n\nI also loved how Chazelle used that Emma Stone coming home scene. It was so simple, but I felt like he totally set the audience up for the idea that it would be Gosling at home, and then to see another man -- oof, wind out of my sails.

Sebastian explains the origin of Jazz as a form of communication between people who didn't speak the same language. How normally when you play Jazz it's a constant push and pull and chaotic series of choices from all the players in the band, a representation of life per say. After 5 years apart, Sebastian didn't have enough words, nor time, in the world to describe his complex feelings to Mia, so he expressed himself through Jazz, but via a song he plays alone without any other musicians or chaos. It's the song/choices he wished he could have played without having to compromise like you do in life.\n\n",

They seemed like opposites in that way.  I think what brought them together was sympathy/support for each other. Once they each had a relatively firm grasp of a plan, the central driving force of their relationship was gone. We the audience weren't given any information as to how the other aspects of their lives meshed (personality, world view, lifestyle choices, etc). I think its reasonable to think those other aspects weren't strong enough to overcome what they had lost - so their relationship effectively ended once Mia got her role. \n\n",

It's completely your choice.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of postmodernism, as it may have come across, and some people may judge this as a good thing.

Do we say, 'hey why are you reviving traditional jazz? You're not black, you're white, it's not for you to do?' It may come to some people's surprise, but we are individuals before our race/colour. In the case of this film, Seb felt passionately about Jazz, and race aside, he simply wanted to keep it alive, it was his passion. \nThe black guy who is Seb's friend, who in turn employs him and helps him earn the cash he needs to make his dream of preserving jazz, opening his own bar dedicated to jazz, a reality, he has a more prominent position than Seb, a successful artist, doing different things with jazz, so what if he's black and revolutionising jazz? If it wasn't for him, Seb's dream wouldn't be a possibility. So it could be seen that without their friendship, the bar dedicated to traditional jazz wouldn't have materialised. Their connection benefitted one another.\nSo can we just stop perpetrating racial discrimination when it's not necessary, such as in this film. If we keep doing this, we'll forever be divided.

It sets the mood for the world they live in and the setting they're up against, then you find that both characters are somewhat oddballs in that world. The second number continues this by showing Mia as a reluctant participant in the party and networking scene and making you expect she'll meet the right person at the party only to meet noone she connects with (until she eventually runs in to Seb at his gig after getting towed). It kind of shows us that the world they're surrounded by does things a certain way and has expectations but it isn't until they both do their own thing they find happiness and success. It then shows the cost of achieving that of course, which makes it all the more important to set expectations from the opening number. It's also an important number to set the tone of the movie as \"this is a straight up musical and love letter to big loud classic Hollywood\".",

It seemed to me that he lost his son at that moment. Andrew gave up his friends and family to have a shot at being the greatest.\n\nLaLa land obviously had the same call out. Sebastian had achieved what he was most passionate about. Sebs was booming. And Jazz was saved, at least in his eyes, but to do that, he had to lose her. In the end, we saw that life for Sebastian would have been great with Mia, but he never would have had the club or done his part to save Jazz.\n\nLike whiplash, I think it lobs the choice to the viewer. What would you want? Achieve your goals or fall in love. What would you give up? It doesn't seem there's a right answer, but that's why I loved both movies.",

            "body": "I think there's an important aspect of their relationship that you passed over by focusing more on Mia. Sebastian's attitude towards their love and his goals was completely different from hers. He sacrificed significantly more for her than she did for him, most clearly when he sold out and began to play in Keith's band. Sebastian even told Mia that he was only a part of the band for her: to be able to provide for her and be \"successful\" since that's what he thought she wanted, based on her conversation with her mother. Even in the final montage of their ideal love playing out, it's all about Mia. Sebastian follows her to Paris, and she still becomes the actress she did, but he never opens his club. That montage leads us to believe that Sebastian did have the qualities Mia needed in her ever-changing life and goals, but Mia didn't have those qualities for Sebastian. It was only once Mia left that Sebastian was able to return to his goal of opening the club. \n\nI don't think the film offers any real explanation for why Mia ended up marrying someone else, other than that's just life. You're right that she had no guarantee that Sebastian would wait for her, but Sebastian didn't have that guarantee either and he did not move on. So it's interesting that Mia was the incompatible one with Sebastian's goals but he was the one who didn't move on and she did.\n\nGoing off of purely anecdotal experiences, it seems that men have a harder time getting over perfectly passionate (\"I'll love you forever\") relationships than women, who seem to rebound fairly quickly. I'm not saying this is always the case, but it has been the case in my life and those close to me, so this movie really connected on that note. I don't have any concluding thoughts on why this is, so I would enjoy further discussion.",

The beginning of the movie and their relationship was largely revolving around their \"dreams\" and then he changed his. Your post makes some contradictions that they were both helping each other achieve their dreams but also says she should accept him tolerating his new job.\n\nAs WeKilledZeus mentioned too, she never asked him to get a steady job or to abandon the jazz club. She wanted him to get a steady job to fulfill his dream- the entire conversation with her mother also reflected this. The scene at his show also showed how lost and confused she was that he was doing something so different from what it seemed he wanted. This scene and the photoshoot also did a good job of showing Gosling's character's discomfort and you could feel the awkward tension. \n\nHowever, I would disagree that her not seeing him is the reason why she brought up the discussion. I think that it was an unexpected and unpleasant addition to their relationship, but more importantly as time went by and the job became higher priority it started becoming evident that this might be \"it\"- no more jazz club.  She is wondering whether this makes him truly happy, doesn't know if he abandoned his original dream, and things are not the same anymore.\n\nThe movie can be interpreted in many ways- an obvious one is that things could always be different. I imagine that while he's playing the last song, he's wondering if he hadn't lost sight of his original goals(love and his dream) then they could've been together and gotten what they both wanted. ",

A solid 30 seconds seemed quite blurry. The scene is a long shot, but seems very basic compared to the other musical sequences. It seemed too big of a mistake to not be intentional, but I don't understand how that would fit thematically? Could anybody shed some light on that?\n\n>  Also noticed in La La Land, Damien did the same camera movement where it went from one person, pan 180 degrees to another person, and then back. In Whiplash it kind of represented the battle going on, but in this I can't remember why it was used, but it worked.\n\nThis is during a sequence in the Lighthouse where Seb is playing piano and Mia is dancing in the crowd.

In other words, the viewers aren't shown the 7-month phone call,\nthe monthly long distance relationship meetups, them trying to live in New York; Mia states she will see her friend back in New York after turning off the fwy to eat.\n\n        \n> I think this news would've broken his heart, and that he poured everything he had into Sebs to fill the void she had left. I feel like that's what Mia walked into when she went to Seb's that night. A Sebastian that never got any real closure. \n\nKeeping with my take on the breakup, I think he got his closure. Towards the end of the film when Sebastian walks out of his car towards his club, there's a giant poster of Mia on the wall; he doesn't acknowledge it or stare longingly...he's whistling with a bit of swagger.\n\n\n> Then that look they shared at the end of an awesome reminder of how we all imagine this paralel universe where everything went as we wished it to...I think on Mias end it was a \"sorry things couldn't work out I really loved you\" , and an acknowledgement on Sebastian's end that it still hurts but they both achieved what they set out to do and that he understands that.\n\nMy take on the [Epilogue] song at the end is that this was their \"album review\" - the type of thing you reflect on to remember an old fling or high school sweetheart. Did you notice that when Sebastian first plays their theme at the restaurant that Mia walks into, it ends a bit abruptly and chaotic...sort of like Seb's life at that time.\n\nSeb starts the theme at the end and I believe that Mia and the audience hear the same uplifting and rythmic take that's in the \"alternate universe\" montage; he's finished it with a melancholy ending but that was **their** theme/tale. Mia doesn't sob, Seb doesn't sob...they acknowledge their roles in each other's lives and bid adieu with a nod and a smile.\n\nMia's [Audition] song struck me, on second viewing, to be a song of heartache that's about to come in the next scene; as if she knows that a Paris shoot would keep them apart and potentially break them up.\n\nIn the end, Mia is shown to be clearly happy and joyful with her family and Seb never compromised his dream because of her...she helped him fulfill it.\n\nEdit: typos",

Seb is a pure artist -- you make it and let the public be dammed if they can't appreciate it. \n4. In the movie, he's forced to really compromise -- and play music for money he can't stand -- for Mia because well love makes you do that. That led to some tension and they break up and really only come together again for the audition.  \n5. Mia never really forgives him for missing her play which he must do because of the commercial choice he makes. \n6. When they do come together again, they know it's over -- their love breached who they were as artists. But, they will always love each other.\n\nCue the City of Stars line -- \"\nI don't care if I know\nJust where I will go\n'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling\nA rat-tat-tat on my heart\"\n\nIn the other version, he plays a different jazz song -- his boss loves the music he plays, he sees her and kisses her, he is at the audition and they fall more traditionally in love. In that world, a love that appreciates him/his Jazz/his art, their love blossoms.\n\nThe take on life is profound even if it not new -- and the way the movie puts it together is an absolute achievement. \n\nYou love your art and perhaps you can't have it all, but that's ok since for some people, art is an ultimate end.\n\nThat's life and it can be sad and melancholy (like the da da da da dadadadada  refrain) but it's freaking beautiful.

He didn't, he gave up it for his dream. While Mia though probably not with the man of her dreams, is from all accounts in a loving relationship with a family to boot. Something, if she stayed with Sebs might have been impossible due the demands, he placed on himself on the mantle of the man who will bring jazz back to it's rightful place and her career. Seeing Mia with her significant other that must have hurt. With no words to express his feelings he played the only thing to convey his thoughts, I dream, a beautiful dream, where all the mistakes he made were never made, where they're love survives all the tribulation of going abroad and Mia's career and where he gives up his dream of being the man who saves jazz to being a family man. Happy to have a wife and home with a child to boot. What his sister has, what Mia has, what he doesn't, but he has jazz, he thought that would enough, it wasn't though. The saddest part is, I think, Seb realizes even though he \"saved\" jazz with his club even in his fantasy his club is still there, just with another individual who \"saved\" jazz.

The Jacques Demy influence is oozing out of this film's every pore, with Demy's trademark Brecht-ian fourth-wall breaks, meta-references, and meticulous emphasis on color \u2014 but the particular influence in *La La Land* comes straight from *Rochefort*. \n\nThe main reoccurring musical theme in \"La La Land\" \u2014 which can be heard in \"A Lovely Night\" and \"Planetarium\", among others \u2014 is a direct interpolation of the melody in \"Chanson de Simon\", as well as a repeated motif throughout *Rochefort* (e.g., Solange plays it on her flute and trumpet in the first 15 mins of the film). That's not including the most general influence of *Rochefort*: The heavily Jazz-centric compositions, it being Demy's Jazz-iest production yet. \n\nGosling's and Stone's entire personalities are each meshes of those portrayed in Delphine, Solange, Simon, Yvonne, Andy, and Maxence \u2014 As a matter of fact, a good chunk of *La La Land*'s narrative and character development is borrowed from the interactions of *Rochefort*'s characters. \n\nThat's not to say Chazelle isn't influenced by *Umbrella* \u2014 there's a poster for the film placed right into the movie \u2014 but that film doesn't really have much specific influence in *La La Land*, or at least compared to the pretty blatant influence of *Rochefort*. Also, the influence of Astaire & Rodgers, and Gene Kelly (who was also in *Rochefort*) films are pretty darn prevalent in the movie too. (One of the scenes towards the end of the dream sequence is basically a recreation of the Broadway Melody scene from *Singin in the Rain*.)\n\nBut I will give you props for mentioning Demy ITT. I'm disappointed I had to scroll down so far to see his id. ",

And once Seb started compromising for the future of jazz, so did the musical parts of the movie. Musical Theatre today is all about change and is *changing*, and so is art, and so are the characters in the film.\n\nAdditionally, I think the fact many critics are critiquing the way the musical elements of the film were done also only adds to the film's message. The \"How can you be a revolutionary if you're such a traditionalist?\" quote from the film actually sums it up.\n\nI think the \"Musical Theatre\" stopped halfway through for a reason.",

These aspirations are so much more important to them, and they needed to be willing to let go of other things to truly follow their dreams to the fullest. I don't think its important that seb finds love. At least for this movie. He isn't really heartbroken, nor is there indication that he is stuck on mia.

Sebastian initiates the squabble, accuses her of lying about being embarrassed about the music his band plays, insults her as an actress, and even states that he doubts anyone would attend her show.\n\nI'm guessing that an argument in which Sebastian says something hurtful was always deemed necessary for a turning point.

They're not supposed to be good.\" And I'm like, \"What?\"\n\nYup, it felt real. That's the point. A musician that plays guitar his whole life, loves jazz or blues w/e, does not have to be a singing god. Probably won't be. That's not how it works. \n\nOk now listen to me.\n\nI don't think it's about relationships. You could see what they wanted to achieve the whole time. Then they doubted when their relationship dipped. \n\nThink about a movie. A normal romance film. \n\nIntro (worldbuilding) - future couple meets - lovey dovey time - doubts or betrayal / missunderstanding - someone tries to fix this whole thing - crescendo into ending everything's fine.\n\nNow replace every romantic plotpoint with their own (Mias and Sebs) dreams. Kinda fits huh? \n\nEven before they meet, we see the characters already focusing on their own thing they love to do. Maybe even more than anyone else. Mia practises for an audition, Seb rewinds his tape so he can memorize the nuances of the song.\n\nIt did not start with a girl having a bad brake-up or a guy getting left. I was never about these themes.\n\nThey achieve everything they always wanted, and people who go in to watch a traditional love movie will get it. Only the end throws them off. Because love was never 100% in the spotlight. \n\nWell, that's what I felt / mean. I loved LaLaLand. I hope you change your mind, even if just a little bit.\n",

            "body": "I actually think it's a genre-defining piece of work as a musical, and it has film historical importance for other reasons. \n\nI mean, first of all, it's 2016 and they shot a film in Scope. Cinemascope historically came about in an era where Hollywood was trying to make the most of new technologies and innovation in technique to appeal to viewers, aka potential cinema-goers got a little distracted by new ways of accessible audiovisual entertainment called Television in 1950s. Jump to 2016: Netflix, streaming, bluray players in every laptop, downloading movies from piratebay - just as big a reason for people not to choose to go to the movies today, pretty similar to the spread of commercial TV in 1950s. Going to the movies has many a unique quality in the experience, and arguably the big screen is #1 in the list of qualities that you just can't get at home. \n\nNow what is Cinemascope: basically a huge ass film projection system. Another similar technology is IMAX, but that has gone the way of 3D: there is no single IMAX theater showing Rogue One in a non-3D projection in my town atm. Not everybody likes 3D; it gives me headaches, and I wear rx glasses so the 3D glasses are just wonky on top of them.\n\n\n**BEWARE SPOILERS BELOW**\n\n*La La Land* is two things above all: throwback and reflexive. Throwback: it's a musical that is episodically broken down into seasons of the year -we've seen this a lot like 50 yrs ago, amirite?- and then you see old Hollywood posters everywhere, and then they talk about Bogart because you have to do that in every throwback movie nowadays. Reflexive: the main girl is an aspiring actor who goes to casting auditions all the time in LA, and then she works at the Warner Bros studios and you get to see a lot of the WB movie sets around; there's a scene almost entirely dedicated to showing the viewer around the WB studios with all fairly empty flirty conversation in the background between Mia and Seb; you even see a film crew shoot a couple's romance scene in one of the sets before they cut and the actors immediately start arguing.\n\nWell, then there is this scene in which Mia and Seb go to the movies to watch *Rebel Without a Cause* - an early Scope film from 1955 when Hollywood was trying to lure more viewers into the movie theater by way of new technology. Now this is where *La La Land* is blending its throwback and self-reflexive qualities so subtly into one awesome movie. Inside the movie theater, Mia and Seb's POV shows the planetarium scene from *RWAC*, and that becomes the movie I'm watching atm, and then the film roll messes up, burns on screen, and it goes out right before the scene in *RWAC* where the students experience the very-captivating Big Bang animation in the planetarium. At this point, the very brief film burns on-screen in *La La Land* are just as captivating as the Big Bang James Dean is looking at in *RWAC*. And then Mia and Seb leave the theater and they go to the same planetarium, and then there's a musical scene where they dance inside the dome, stars and space all around.\n\n**SPOILERS END**\n\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is: *La La Land* is making use of some retro technology -CinemaScope- to make movies great again in a year in which my friend just watched Kubrick's *2001* on one of those small movie screens on a plane. I mean, come on. Damien Chazelle realizes that retro technology has got some unique qualities that new technology just does not inherently possess, and that variation in movie technology is just not limited to film vs digital. *La La Land* is subtle but proud in its technique -simply beautiful perspective distortion at the edges in every single closeup- and all that it's doing is simply reusing old technology instead of holding onto a violent consumerist tendency to invent new technologies, because hey, Scope is beautiful and of course I wanna watch some new films shot in scope, make more!!!\n\n**tl;dr:** I just wrote a 700-word reddit comment so I guess that's how much I liked this movie, now go watch it.",

Now I cannot praise this movie and these songs enough.\n\n> Also, and I have to mention it, the fact it is the whitest musical about historically black music ever.\n\nYour spoiler point after that seems to miss the mark.  When Sebastian wants to show Mia jazz, he takes her to listen to the darkest brothers in the movie; likewise, most of the people he performs with are black.  Sebastian is not, as Forest Whitaker's character put it in *The Last King of Scotland*, trying to \"play the white man\"; he is a single musician trying to save what *is* a dying art form in a way that he wants it to endure and grow. \n\nMuch like a Vietidse guy in a house on fire is not going to care about the racial makeup of the firemen who save him, what does it matter that a white guy numbers among the people trying to save jazz?  It's not like there were no great white jazz artists - and even if there were not, who cares?  Would a movie about a black ballerina make you \"have to mention\" (really?  you \"have to\"?) the fact that ballerinas historically have been lily white?",

There's a section in the middle where the musical numbers even fade away a bit, and a lot of them are centered on the two leads alone throughout. It's really excellent, I definitely can't recommend it highly enough. If you love Chazelle's other work I think you'll enjoy this\u2014it's tonally very different from Whiplash in that it's much more optimistic and vibrant, but I don't think you have to worry about it being like a Luhrmann film or anything.

Mia laid the groundwork for Seb's bar and Seb not only drove Mia to her successful audition but advised her to pursue an acting career wholeheartedly. Their relationship was done once Seb signed on with Keith's band. His constant traveling and her move to France would had kept them apart for much longer than they would had liked. Therefore, they broke up. The ending showed the movie coming full circle. A traffic jam and happenstance brought them together again. Upon seeing each other, they immediately regretted the mistakes made during their relationship. Above all, they regretted not being with each other.

To be fair, we don't really know how long she was dating the first boyfriend (she wasn't dating him in the first scenes) and the movie doesn't focus on their relationship because it's not that important to the story. \n\nI actually thought the ending was realistic. You never forget your first love and you might always wonder what might have been, but oftentimes circumstances prevent young people in love from staying together. I don't think it's fair to say Mia's husband was a \"consolation prize\". Again, their relationship isn't fleshed out because it's not important to the story. It's pretty clear that Mia is very happy with her daughter and her husband appears to adore her. \n\nSebastian and Mia probably got together because they were in the right place at the right time, but when their situations changed, they weren't willing to have one person give up his/her dream and risk resenting one another. They certainly loved each other, and they will always be important to one another, but realistically, they probably were not the best partners for one another. We only see them falling in love, but not really staying in love or working through problems together. ",

            "body": "This was a very divisive movie for me.  On one hand, the choreography, music, direction, cinematography were absolutely terrific.  I have been listening to the soundtrack non stop.  On the other hand, the pacing was rough and they should have hired actors who could actually sing and dance (and no, I didn't think the clumsiness is not \"vulnerability\" or \"endearing\").  I like Gosling and Stone and they did the best they could, but ultimately they aren't triple threats and the content far exceeded their skills (although they did put in good acting performances).  Like you say, they should have found less recognizable stage actors/singers/dancers for the roles.  As it was, it was really off-putting to see the near bumbling during some of the numbers, and hear the great songs sung off-key in some parts.\n\nAlso, your point on motivating more baristas to move to LA/NY is entirely valid. My sister is successful in the business and she worked literally from the time she was 6 years old to get where she is now. It's constant, unforgiving, structured, stick-to-it work that gets most actors their.  No parties, no staying out late, no drinking, no drawn out relationships to weigh you down. It's also constant compromise (which was nicely touched on with the tour subplot with the Seb character).  It's not, \"I'm going to move to LA/NY to be magically discovered and do what the muse tells me\".",

I really really did not like the movie (nor did my mom or sister or grandma, so I don't think it's an age thing). I sort of feel like I'm living in a weird alternate emperor's-new-clothes universe where everyone loved a movie I didn't enjoy at all, but I'll try to articulate why I didn't. People seem to feel really strongly about it, so I'm a bit hesitant. I swear I'm not trying to be a hater.\n\n1. The movie was weirdly paced and felt too long. Every scene felt like it could have ended five minutes earlier than they did.\n2. To me, it lacked something substantive. It felt like junk food, you know? I'm not sure how to explain it.\n3. Both characters were not very likable, despite the actors giving good performances. I honestly did not want Seb to succeed because he was full of himself and rude. Neither character had any actual adversity to overcome. I wasn't rooting for them or their relationship, because I didn't really care about either.\n4. Both actors are very talented, but didn't really sing very well (which you mentioned, but I think it warrants bringing up because it partly seemed directional). I thought this was weird because Emma Stone definitely can sing, and you see some of that the end audition song. The breathy thing she did the whole time was off-putting and very probably how she was directed to sing but I was not feeling it.\n5. The plot was straight up boring. Nothing happened until about an hour into the movie.\n6. The colors were great, but the camera work I found to be too much. The little spin the at the end of scenes was cool the first time, and then was not the next 6.\n7. I know you brought up the songs and it not being a real musical, but the songs were not very good. The use of the same song over and over was repetitive and annoying.\n8. I have family/friends in the business and I definitely like entertainment. That being said, it did feel a bit masturbatory sometimes.\n\nI hope some of these made sense. I feel odd being in the \"hate it\" camp because I genuinely like most movies. I'm not trying to offend anyone and I get people have differing opinions from me but I very honestly can't tell why people love this movie when I found it so unengaging.\n\nJohn Legend is the man though.",

They both still love each other, but 5 years is a long time and a lot has happened. Even though they both know and even we the audience know they belong together, life interfered.

The cinematography was amazing and colorful and gave us some excellent dancing sequences.

I would assume that when you have two leads who arn't professional singers or dancers, you do your best to make sure it doesn't stand out (hide isn't the right word, you just tailor the singing and dancing to their abilities).\n\nThey did a good job doing that with the dancing, but the singing was already noticeably just fine, and to bring on a spectacular singer like Legend created a really big contrast. I get that they really wanted him to represent the \"professional\" scene versus what the characters were doing in the movie, but I think they should've weighed the practical effect of having John Legend in the movie as opposed to just the thematic effect.\n\nWe spend the whole movie with Ryan and Emma, not John Legend or the other actual dancers.",

Even though I liked it, the story is one of the weaker aspects of this film, as a lot of it is overshadowed by the musical numbers and how they're paced. As I'm writing this, it sounds stupid to say considering that by the nature of the genre, the musical numbers are supposed to be the highlights of the film. It would've been nice if they slowed down with it and spread it out more evenly so that the Spring and Summer parts didn't drag so much in the story department.\n\nThat, and I think the movie could've dialled it down with the dream sequences, like in the Griffith Observatory scene and the ending. I really thought the ending was a perfect fit for the story, but it goes on a tangent in the dream part of it made me want the movie to just end. \n\nI think you would enjoy Damien Chazelle's previous film 'Whiplash' more, as it's a lot more grounded in its story and characters, and has it balanced out more skillfully with the music sequences. Which brings me to another complaint with La La Land, how they rehashed the jazz saviour complex of J.K. Simmons' character with Sebastian. But that's for another time.",

            "body": "Hey, film is subjective - nobody is going to love all of the good films, it doesn't help that the general audience loves the film so much that it's the only thing anybody is talking about. I personally LOVED this film, I have never in my life wanted to actually watch a film twice in the cinemas - but with La La Land the first time I watched it I was like, \"holy shit that was pretty good film I wanna see it again!\" Second time around I loved it even more - so much so it became one of my all time favourites. I mean me and my dad listened to the first song like a dozen times.\nAnyways, there is so much brilliance in La La Land - it's so creative, engaging and fun! I never much cared for dancing or musicals - but just the opening scene of La La Land is so genius. The choreography was amazing - the camera travelled so smoothly in the mess of the dancing and it all felt beautiful. The opening song was also incredibly catch, well-sung and the lyrics were surprisingly incredibly smart (listen closely and you'll realise the song is about the film). That's just the opening scene alone. \nThe acting in the film was amazing too - that scene with Emma Stone singing that song for the audition, man that was some hard-hitting shit. Ryan Gosling was phenomenal too - I mean the way he sang City of Stars, the way he acted on the Piano and the way he danced was mind-blowing to me. I mean I was 100% emotionally invested in the film, the characters and there journies. That made the Epilogue seen so hard-hitting and emotion-packed.\nAlso, Damian Chazelle is such a genius! NOBODY is making blockbuster musicals or jazz films anymore - Old Hollywood is over. But Damian Chazelle brought it back for 2 hours - and those 2 hours were beautiful indeed. I mean the opening songs lyrics are a direct tie-in with the movie, the dance scenes choreography is the best I've ever seen (but again I don't know musicals, so I might be wrong about the choreography) the acting was brilliant, the story was so emotionally captivating and fun yet so clever and brilliant. The ending was genius because it showed the brilliance and fun of the Old Hollywood movies but deconstructed them and the \"perfect ending\" or the \"American dream\" and that is something nobody really tries to do. The last time I saw such a brilliant ending which courageously did what this film did was Casablanca, and even though Casablanca is probably in my top 50 films of all time and I love it- I am beginning to feel that this might be even better (and that's big because I don't like musicals and I used to think Casablanca is the greatest film of all time).",

The last 20-minutes justifies it all and refutes many of the criticisms one might have against it. Remember, it's about a couple things -- love, fate, passion, art, and really an ode to Jazz and what that art form says about such themes.\n\n[I didn't get the ending until I realized it's Chazelle's realism at play here -- the perfect ending might not happen -- and the movie musical of the past might have given you that -- not this one, it has so much more to see say about the true nature of love and the artist's mind -- that Gosling's bad signing enhances it and offers a gritty realism to the whole thing that the ending makes even more powerful.   My take on is that's it's a whole jazz song as Sebastian states -- something freeform, not caring about the result, but caring about the creating. That's why the montage is so powerful -- remember, in both realities they meet and fall in love and go onto success. But, if Sebastian just kissed her there instead of stormed off in fury, he shows up at the play, never meets Keith and he goes to Paris with her. That would have been a different jazz song/movie so to speak and just was not the one he was playing that night.] (#spoiler) Let your own brain think about what is says about fate/free will/destiny. A true artist does not care so much about the result as long as she/he is creating/going at it.  ",

In old Hollywood musicals the chemistry between the leads is usually cemented in word play, but that never really happened. Stone and Gosling kind of poke fun at each other and then admit through song that they couldn't possibly be feeling anything for one another; which is appropriate because at that point nothing has happened to suggest that they are interested in one another.\n\nMy big gripe with the movie is that that songs don't convey the story the way they do in a musical. In musicals the songs drive the plot forward like dialogue, but in this film they seemed tacked on as a gimmick almost. In fact when Emma Stone sang the song about her Aunt, I had entirely forgotten that I was watching a musical. I enjoy musicals, but it felt like the film couldn't decide what to do with it's own numbers. Are they the centerpiece of the film? No. Are they ironic interludes? No. There seemed to be too few musical numbers, and of too little importance. The strongest scene in the film for me was the argument over dinner, and I wished the movie would have followed the tone of that scene (not arguing, but realism). Because the songs don't drive the plot, I think they could be removed entirely and the film would still make sense, and might even be better.\n\n",

In fact, if you go to the post game thread for the golden globes, most people were upset that La La Land won best screenplay, as that was arguably the weakest part of the movie. I disagree regarding the performances. I think Emma stone gave a phenomenal performance that really resonated with me. I liked Ryan gosling as well, but not nearly as much as Emma stone.\n\nNot liking the music is subjective I guess. I personally loved all the music, especially city of stars. \n\nAs for the relationship between Seb and Mia, I never got the impression that they were meant to be soulmates or were perfect for each other. I think their relationship was just meant to represent an obstacle that people face through their lives when attempting to pursue their purpose/dream. We've all had relationships where you're with someone you're not necessarily supposed to be with other then the fact that you guys had a great \"honeymoon\" period. I felt their relationship was real in that it was simply a catalyst for them to pursue their dreams, and not meant to be a long term thing. I feel like the message of the movie is about dreams and what we sacrifice to pursue them, not really about Seb and Mia. \n\nI don't think this was a love story between 2 people, it was a love story between each of these people and their dreams",

The music embodies all of the emotional highs and lows they are experiencing in the first part of the film until they inevitably have to deal with reality and make choices regarding their dreams. It's very dream-like in the beginning. As soon as their relationship starts to fracture, you hear less music until the epilogue which encapsulates the \"what could have been\". I think having a happy ending would have lessened the impact of the choices they made. It would have become a cliche romance. The ending is bittersweet and much more grounded in reality. If you haven't already seen it, I'd check out Umbrellas of Cherbourg by Jacques Demy. The tone of this film was clearly inspired by Umbrellas of Cherbourg amongst others.

That's the driver of the conversation. Sebastian resists and lashes out but still manages to say something that Mia needs to hear.

One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer ids and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.

The part that makes me weep like a child who was told Santa didn't exist was despite loving each other, they sacrifice their relationship to achieve their dreams - Sebs needed the touring money to start his club and Mia went to Paris to start her acting career. They couldn't keep in touch and life happens, understandably with their busy schedule. The look Seb gives Mia after the what ifs montage broke my heart... at least they can find comfort with the fact that they both achieved the dream they set out to do at the start of the film. \n",

The Act II \"obstacles\" Mia running into Sebastian at the party, followed up by the \"turning point\" of *A Lovely Night*. The next obstacle would be Mia's dinner with her boyfriend's brother, and almost missing the theater date. The \"disaster\" or \"crisis\" would probably be Sebastian overhearing Mia talking to her mom about his lack of steady job, which spurs him onto joining the band, which causes the Act II climax of the dinner argument and Mia's play failing and the relationship ending. It all gets wrapped up with the final audition and the \"five years later\" bit. \n\nThat's more or less what I got. But yeah, the Act II/III conflict/climax is pretty standard in any story. ",

You spent the entire film being romantic and building up the relationship between these two, only to shatter it. \nI'm just not sure why such a movie based in fantasy and whimsy would have such a cynical conclusion. It seems wrong to show the audience the ending they've been rooting for only to rip it away and say, in classic Wayne's World fashion, \"NOT!\"\n\n**I'm going to discuss the endings of Good Will Hunting, Annie Hall, 500 Days of Summer, and When Harry Met Sally. If you haven't seen them, beware of spoilers.**\n\nI don't buy the, \"Well, that's what real life is like.\" Especially not for this movie! The whole thing was a fantasy. Would Good Will Hunting have been better if at the end Will took the job, didn't go after Skyler, since that's how things would go in real life?\n\nAt the end of Annie Hall it's bittersweet, but you're not crushed that Annie and Alvy aren't together. You get the feeling that they've both moved on with their lives, and they're better people because of their time together, but they're not devastated imagining the life that they could have lived.\n\nEven in 500 Days of Summer you understand that they were never really meant for each other. He was selfish, and he didn't realize that.\n\nI would have much preferred something like When Harry Met Sally, which is on the surface, a much more cynical film than La La Land. But when Billy Crystal runs into the party and says 'When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible' it reenforces the fact that these two should be together.\n",

He doesn't replace the Samba and Tapas place. He uses the id she suggested.

In reality, you have to choose which dreams to follow and make sacrifices for them. There is conflict and compromise, which the perfect dream lacks.\n\nAlso, even though they both feel remorse over losing each other, the film ends with them sharing a slight smile.

It suits his character as a jazz musician so much more.  When you meet a lot of jazz musicians nowadays you get the impression that they would have adored being born in a different era when jazz was coming into its own.   My brother is a jazz musician and the way Sebastian talks in Lala land reminds me so much of him ",

Nothing Ryan Gosling himself played was remotely like jazz, not even the traditional variety. The whole soundtrack, while beautiful, was filled with what a classically trained composer/pianist might imagine is a jazz-like sound, not the actual thing. It didn't even sound like Broadway, which boasts plenty of numbers that are authentically jazzy - if anything, New Age would be a better moniker. I also found myself agreeing with every single word that John Legend's character said about revitalizing jazz by looking towards the future, because that's what the most artistic, talented, and trailblazing groups are doing today. While they did a good job of showing that Legend's band wasn't actually living up to that ambition despite their commercial success, I also felt that that revelation considerably cheapened the conflict between Gosling's passion for a more traditional sound and the various real-world constraints he was facing.

When they do this, their individual desire to achieve their dreams will ultimately separate them and they will end up moving on from each other.\n\nIn a perfect world, they would each achieve their dreams effortlessly and get to spend their lifes together.

What did Mia really do for Sebastian other than design his sign? Sebastian convinced Mia to write and put on her one-woman show, and drove to Boulder City to take her to her audition, all of which made Mia a famous actress. If Sebastian had never met Mia, his life would have pretty much turned out the same if Keith had gotten in contact with him.\n\nFurthermore, in the end, they're not even friends. She doesn't even know he opened the jazz club: she found out about it by accident. We spend the entire movie with them together, and in the end, they're more like distant acquaintances, which makes no sense in the story or even in the movie as a whole. \n\nI don't know what /u/isarge123 is talking about, in those final moments, where they look at each other, I saw sadness. And that fantasy sequence where they think about what could have happened drove it even deeper. I saw no positivity or happiness in that ending.\n\nI know this is going on really long, but I think one thing that maybe *maybe* could have saved that ending, is if they showed *both* sides of what could have happened. I think we were shown the \"What if Sebastian gave up his dream so Mia could pursue hers\" fantasy, but never the \"What if Mia gave up her dream so Sebastian could pursue his\", and both times show the pain of giving up their dreams would have made their lives worse off than if they just split apart.",

What they had was so good, it mattered, it made each other better. Didn't your heart almost whisper, \"they're meant to be with each other...\"? Mine sure yelled it out loud. \n\nIt's such a sad reality that that kind of love is spoiled or comes to an end because one person forgets about that love, gets distracted by flings, etc. (I think this was the case in Sebastian's and Mia's relationship, mainly because of Mia either forgot or got distracted. It certainly happens in the real world). I think that type of mutual selfless love is a love that's meant to stay together forever, all others constant (which I know is hard to hold as a constant, but should nevertheless be tried).",

But I think there's a difference in that Andrew didn't love his girlfriend whereas Sebastian loved his. Andrew didn't sacrifice anything for his girl, but Sebastian did - (1) he sacrificed his plan to achieve his dream by joining Legend's band and (2) his relationship with Mia for her sake, not his - I know this may seem like circular reasoning, but I'd argue that it was indeed a sacrifice because he gained nothing by ending his relationship with Mia. \n\nIn the end, we didn't merely see Sebastian dodging a bullet because his fantasy didn't involve him owning his own jazz club. Instead, we realize that, if he could do it again, then he would have followed Mia even at the expense of fully achieving his dream. We realize this because he's imagining it. It's what he wants.

If only she saw that the sacrificial love that Sebastian had for her was for her good, she might've looked past his unwise decision to stay in Legend's band and help him devise a wiser plan to become financially stable and achieve his dream at the same time. Because she didn't fully receive Sebastian's sacrificial love, it was easy for her to move on. \n\nAnd to the note about why it seems like men have a harder time getting over perfectly passionate relationships - I don't know if this is true since I have known numerous women taking years to get over relationships. My hypothesis is that people who are less concerned with the fulfillment of their personal ambition, perhaps people who think of themselves less and considers themselves as less than others,  are the ones who suffer more since they yearn for the type of love that themselves would be willing to give to others. Since their standard for others is the standard to which they hold themselves, they are left with anger, frustration when other people couldn't deliver at the standard that they delivered at. This is a very premature thought, so I'd love to hear your thoughts on it!",

I'm not saying this is always the case, but it has been the case in my life and those close to me, so this movie really connected on that note.\n\n\nI have read that this is related to the size and strength of your non-romantic social network. Many men have only a few real friends, so there's not much of a network to distribute the shock, if you will, when a romantic relationship ends. There's less there to catch you. Many women, on the other hand, have a more extensive network of friends and even very close friends, which offer more support in the wake of a break-up and help them recover faster. Of course, generalizations are just that and there are counter-examples going both ways; it's the network of close friends that really makes the difference, and that's just correlated with gender.",

Also, their perfect married life at the very end is literally Mia's life with her husband but with Seb in his place, so it's not like what they presume would have happened if they stayed together would actually happen.\n\nOr maybe I'm just lying to myself so I don't burst into tears thinking about the life Mia and Seb could have had together, who knows.",

We saw that they aren't huge on communication, what with Mia calling Seb to say she hadn't heard from him \"for a while\". \n\n\nWhen you are with someone who is extremely dedicated to their dream, often times, you become second place to that. I've seen it happen often in academia. People put love, family, friends, health on the line to work towards their dream. It can very much play off the same as how Miles Teller's character was in Whiplash. To be as happy as you can be with another person, one of you is going to sacrifice more than the other. When that happens, it can cause a rift like how Seb felt about joining the Messengers because he didn't want to be pathetic to Mia's parents. Mia's fantasy at the end even hints at this because Seb at the end doesn't own the club and he's just following her life. He plays traditional jazz in that fantasy and enjoys it passionately but he didn't make \"Seb's\".",

This is fused with a dream sequence which serves a similar purpose to the one in *An American in Paris*, as well.](#spoiler)",

If you look at old Charlie Chaplin films, you can see that he spent ours on end just to get a single moment right. Part of me sees this is as an artistic whitewashing excuse for doing what Hollywood does too often, foregoing quality and hard work for easy star power and marketing. I think some parts of the film are great, don't get me wrong, but I think what pervades through the film is this half commitment. It gets a few things about life in Hollywood right, but not everyone looks like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, not every actor can even get auditions, and the chances for being flown out to Paris for a lead role are slim to none. It gives a bittersweet ending without going into the real meat of why the relationship didn't work. In the end, I guess that sums up my criticism as a whole: a half-baked shell of something with a lot of potential that took the easy and safe roads at every turn, and it shows. A nice movie to watch on a date, but not particularly praise or Oscar worthy.",

At least in the end - obviously he'd expected her to wait for him, but at least he was considering her in his 'I'm a success future'. \n\nSeb's success was at least in part tied up with having Mia, whereas he was spurring her on, but ultimately a bit of a launchpad (he encouraged her to write her one-woman play, got her to do for the audition from her parents' place...), and all he was left with was his club's id and logo, which presumably serve as a constant reminder of Mia for him - who's also inescapable for him, since her face is plastered everywhere in town anyway.\n",

You want to press forwards with your life and justify your decision to part ways with this person which you still harbour deep feelings for. It's actually rather astute in my eyes and shows how deep the feelings of the characters go. It highlights that they will never have a purely platonic relationship so they have to stay away from each other.

Like Sebastian's obsession with jazz, it'll never again be as relevant as it once was, or as pioneering or innovative.  New jazz feels like old jazz - an imitation.\n\nThe *real* innovation is happening in other areas of music - I guess rap, EDM, etc in our lifetimes - that stuff's new, changing, completely brand new.  Maybe in 10 years they'll also be old and something new will take it's place - my point is that it's hard to resurrect any movement because it happened, it served it's purpose, culture kept expanding.\n\nFor example, golden age musicals were born in a time of war - so there was an emphasis on positive, exuberant messages - and high censorship.  They're sweet and nostalgic now, but they definitely don't present the world in a very accurate way.  I'm not saying they have to, but it's just like we've grown up as a culture a little bit - just like how certain things appeal to you as a kid until you grow out of them.\n\nI think there's stuff that's just hardwired in our collective psyche now that we've grown out of - so it's going to be difficult for the same naivet\u00e9 that was enchanting in the 40s and 50s to really mean anything to a regular moviegoer when film itself has expanded so much and explored so much.",

A two hour movie about a great couple who are constantly making sacrifices to achieve their dreams/ be with each other ending this way would have been a lot stronger than the film we got which was an hour and 30 minute romantic comedy that suddenly becomes a hard drama right at the end.\n\nLove itself can be a powerful motivator to achieve ones dreams and it can also be a detriment and it's weird that a film about choosing between love and following ones dreams doesn't delve deeper into the subject matter. I just feel like it's a missed opportunity as from what I've read Chazelle based the movie of his own relationship with his ex-wife yet he fails to bring up the subtleties that make a decision like this so hard.\n\nThe movie reminds me a lot of The Artist, great on paper and a wonderful film to watch but I feel like it's going to be forgotten with time because it doesn't have that hard hitting human element to it.",

Then again, she is an actress. \n\n\" It's pretty clear that Mia is very happy with her daughter and her husband appears to adore her.\" Yes, but does Mia adore her husband? Maybe, or maybe he was just conveniently available. I think it can be fair to possibly say Mia's husband was a consolation prize - assuming she actually really loved Seb. If circumstances weren't an issue, who would she choose to be with? If the answer is Seb, then yes, her husband is getting a raw deal. \n\nThen again, I really don't think Seb and Mia were in \"love\", at least not romantic love. That term gets tossed around a lot, like someone changing socks, but personally I think its rare. My interpretation is that they were in a fragile moment in their lives, had some infatuation and emotional dependency (with respect to pursuing their dreams) that extended the relationship a bit, but it was never true romantic love, more like love for a friend. \n\nTheir relationship wasn't romantic love but more of a support system, once they no longer needed it, they no longer needed each other, but since they weren't robots there was some lingering nostalgia - hence the final scene.

Dude, in Whiplash there's a great dynamic between the characters...and subtleties in the plot...and a great twist at the end...WHY NOT USE SOME OF THOSE TRICKS IN YOUR NEXT FILM and shape them in various ways to not only take us on this musical ride, but give us characters we care about and a plot that has at least SOME traces of novelty and irony? God, I felt like the love story in Whiplash was certainly the worst part of the film...and now that I think about it, the relationship between Sebastian and Mia was just as weirdly paced and un-fleshed out to me. And I'm tired of people being like...\"It was a musical! Musicals are like that!\" Nothing is more stagnating than that logic.

Not yet having seen Fences and Silence (both of which could do some serious damage in terms of awards), I feel as if La La Land, Moonlight and Manchester By The Sea are all fantastic Oscar-type movies that could each either sweep many of the awards or split them fairly equally. All three have phenomenal cinematography, score, script and acting (in various categories), and each IMO has a pretty good chance at director/best picture at the Oscars. La La Land is showy and the kind of movie a lot of people who may be prototypical academy members love, but bear in mind they added a lot of members this year in the wake of #OscarsSoWhite and Moonlight seems like the perfect film to show they mean business. And at the same time Manchester By The Sea is just a phenomenal movie with amazing storytelling and a pitch perfect performance from Casey Affleck which probably has that Best Actor category locked down.\n\nAnd like I said I'm still missing Silence and Fences which could both also be phenomenal. And I didn't much like Jackie but it was a well-made film with a great score, a revered performance and great production/set/costume design.\n\nOther than those 3 mentioned my top 5 includes The Lobster (which is the most original movie I've seen in a while) and Rogue One, and there are some real great off-the-beaten path movies that I loved this year like Captain Fantastic, Hell or High Water, Hunt for the Wilder-People, Midnight Special... even some great bigger/more commercial movies that I can see myself rewatching a lot. Deadpool, 10 Cloverfield Lane, The Nice Guys, both Marvel movies were great, Arrival, Star Trek...\n\nThere were a lot of bad blockbusters this year but IMO more great movies this year and a couple of REALLY great movies.",

I have nothing against struggling artists, but it's something that's been done to death.

But in both universes it is Seb who saves Mia from giving up on her dream - by inspiring her to do her show in the first place and then either forcing her to do the Paris audition as in the main timeline, or by presumably making her happy enough for her show to be a success by not joining the band in the alternative one.](#spoiler)",

I also couldn't really differentiate between the any of the four voices in the scene with Mia and her roommates, it was all very airy and weak headvoice.

It doesn't make the \"What could have been?\" any less wistful and resonant, like she said\u2014they'll always love each other. But I love that there's an implicit, \"Thank you\" shared wordlessly between them. Maybe their relationship wasn't built to last given their ambitions, they were there for each other at just the right time in their lives\u2014and because of that, it will always be an incredibly special relationship to the both of them. They'll wonder from time to time, but they'll always be thankful they had each other and they don't need that one magical Hollywood romance to be happy. They've achieved their dreams. \n\nIt's an interesting dichotomy with *Whiplash*, where Andrew feels he needs to sacrifice personal relationships to achieve his dreams. Here they never would've achieved them if they hadn't found one another and encouraged and supported one another. It's a nice riposte to the tortured individual artist clich\u00e9, their love and support was what made the difference, even if it meant that they would drift apart at the end. It's not saying artists can't have fulfilling personal relationships, it's just saying that due to the point they are at in their careers these two characters wouldn't have been able to continue on their relationship in a fulfilling way\u2014and they're both happy to have just helped facilitate the other person achieving their goals, which is just such a selfless love really. Ugh, I just really loved this movie. The ending strikes just the right balance between valuing artistic ambitions and finding personal fulfillment while acknowledging the power and necessity of strong relationships for support as well.

The first scene for example, which everyone is raving about, was shot against the light, leaving the protagonists faces always in the dark. I get that it was shot on location, but musicals are about the choreography and visuals. In this respect it failed.  \nRyan Gosling and Emma Stone were so miscast, if you do a song and dance movie, get some actors that can actually sing and dance. He gave such a wooden performance and Emma Stone looks like an Alien baby, but ok, that is just my opinion.  \nThe whole story and much of the dialog was just bad and cringeworthy at times. Who goes to the observatory in the middle of the night and just wanders around? I feel the use of real locations made every song and dance piece very claustrophobic and heavily edited when these kinds of movies need to feel fluid and continuous. Just look at any Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers pieces.\nThe choreographer, already working with dancing stiffs, had another hurdle to overcome.  \nJohn Legend?? Wtf, thanks for the extra dosage of white people cheese.\nBeing the only white people in that Jazz club? Come on...\nThe movie was supposed to be lighthearted and witty but just came across as really somber because Ryan Gosling looks like a soon to be violent alcoholic and Emma Stone is stuck in the body of a 12 year old. All those close ups of her singing did not help her cause. \nEverybody Says I Love You did it better, even the dance number alone in 500 Days of Summer was better than this heap of pretencious millenial crap.  \nIf you want to see an original and actually well directed musical go rent Phantom of The Paradise and save your money.",

If you look at the \"what could have been\" scene, you see that the two end up happily together, but Sebastian never actually achieves his dream of opening his club at the Van Beek. Instead, he follows Mia to Paris and they spend their lives together, Mia achieving her dream of being a movie star and Sebastian at least happily playing real jazz in clubs. When the couple stumbles upon the club that in reality became \"Seb's,\" he is intrigued rather than upset that someone else accomplished his dream. And I mean, that seems true to life. Growing up, most people have these huge goals for themselves and we encounter conflict and we make compromises and we end up going down completely different roads than we had envisioned, and yet most people don't get down on themselves that they never worked for NASA or wrote a best-selling novel, because as you get older you come to realize that you don't need to have a best-selling novel in order to be happy and live a good life. Here, the characters had an opportunity to be happy together, but rather than compromise their dreams, Mia went to Paris and Sebastian stayed behind.  Something like that.\n\n\nThat and I think it was kind of intended to be sort of a \"we'll always have LA\" thing after the throwback to Casablanca with the whole \"you're gonna get on that plane\" scene",

Sort of like \"if only he had been to my one-woman show and there was a full house, we never would have had that fight and I wouldn't have gone back to my parents house\" or \"if only he had gone with me to Paris, he could have opened his own club there and we'd be happy together\". \n\nEverything she's imagining is unrealistic because life isn't perfect. But the song takes her back to the feelings of love that she has for him, and she has a serious moment of \"what if we could be together\". ",

We see in LaLa Land that the window looks out toward a coffee shop, on a studio set... Is it still romantic when you see it in full daylight, stripped of its glamour? I think this is one of the questions the movie wants us to answer. ",

Harmony Korine cast Rosario Dawson after seeing her sitting on her own front porch.  Stuff like that happens.

Looking at the sequence of events from a music perspective is an interesting suggestion - they are similar in many respects: his seasons with Mia indeed consisted of conflict (fight with Mia over his joining Legend's band) and compromise (ending the relationship with her). His seeing Mia at the end with another man was definitely an unexpected event, making it \"new every time\" and (I say this hesitantly) \"exciting\". In that sense, Sebastian's character could be considered an art. But classifying the entirety of his life in the movie as art and diminishing the love that he had with Mia as a sub section of that classification is slightly dehumanizing. He was willing to make love the hallmark of his life and jazz, a subsection of that, as evidenced by his imagining of a scenario of what he would do if he could do it again. Let's make love shine, all above others! ",

And she even wins the coveted role after singing - something she hasn't really done up until then. By the end, his solo jazz is the most effective means to convey his feelings to her.

And I also pointed out several correlations between *La La Land*'s and *Rochefort*'s narratives and characters. \n\nBut for some reason, while typing, the spoiler part of your post started bugging out and kept moving the screen up and down. I couldn't copy and salvage what I had written, and couldn't just hit save to edit and finish it because the screen was twitching so much haha. So I just had to refresh and lose it. (I'm posting from mobile btw.)\n\nAnyway, despite losing my initial response, I think it's safe to say that, at best, *La La Land* is Chazelle's love letter to Demy's work in general, rather than debating over which of his two films hold more weight in *La La Land*. And while the Demy influence is unavoidable in the movie, we also can't forget the other blatant homages to Astaire, Rodgers, and Kelly. :)",

I don't think a movie needs the character or story to have a big dramatic moment to be a great movie. I actually dislike a movie trying to be realistic to have a big physical change because that does not happen in real life. I can't connect to a character that suddenly changes into something else. It feels more like a lesson rather than a movie trying to connect with me.  I mean the films you say are the same as Manchester, I love(except for Boyhood because that film had horrible acting) because I could easily relate to the characters and can feel what they are feeling and can appreciate parts of my life through that. \n\nOk whatever.

In a way, this adds to the movie. \n\nIn Seb's case, he changed himself and his view of Jazz in order to make progress, without being rejected as he never put himself out there (besides being a pain to his boss when we first hear him play the piano publicly). Mia pushed and supported him, yet nudged him to change in order to achieve success.\n\nIn Mia's case, she went through millions of coffee cups and shitty auditions in order to make progress, being rejected over and over and over. Seb supported her to be herself, to do it herself, to be independent, not to sacrifice who she was to acting; that if she'd just focus on being true to her, she'd find the right job. She wrote her own show, and then she did exactly that: found the right job. \n\nPart of the point was they both saw in eachother what they either had or hadn't seen in themselves. Their relationship was love: give and take. The movie was about compromise. \n\nAt the end, it may seem like Seb is more... 'unhappy.' I agree he might be reminded of Mia more than Mia is reminded of him. He sacrificed for his dream. \n\nBut didn't Mia also? She has the husband and the child, yes. But the only view we have of her future is her leaving her child with a nanny to go to some social event. She's a socialite, a star. She doesn't get to spend as much time with her own kid, and in a way, isn't that a worse sacrifice than changing the id of a jazz club? Mia has a reputation to uphold, she became a star and must live out her stardom. Both made sacrifices. \n\nAaaah! I just adore this movie and could go on and on and on. \n\nLa La Land starts conversations, asks questions. And doesn't give you any of the answers. This is what I love about the film!",

I started picking up on some details I had not noticed the first time, including some foreshadowing I had missed (like in the opening song) and the significance of some references I had not seen or understood.  Now I go around with all the songs (including the opening one) in my head and cannot stop raving about and reading reviews of this movie.  I have said elsewhere that I probably could tell which reviewers have seen this movie only once or not by how much they geek out over it, because I see my own former ambivalence in reviews that shit on this movie as much as I see my own convert's zeal in reviews flipping out over it.\n\nParticularly with music, I need more than one go-round to get into new pieces of art but, as with most of my favorite music, once a song gets into my head, it is there to stay.  These songs just moved in and already have unpacked.  They are unbelievable and in the context of this movie definitely is the way to experience them for the first couple of times.  Enjoy!",

They would have already gotten to experience success and personal fulfillment! Who wouldn't go back and do things differently in hindsight?

Those smiles at the end weren't just for show; they're proud of each other, despite what they've lost.\n\nMaybe what you took from this film is that living an idyllic romantic love and sacrificing your professional aspirations is a more meaningful way of living than what you saw onscreen. That's fine, it's your prerogative. It wasn't theirs, however, and it certainly may not be the same for others in the movie theater. Also take the film with a grain of salt: it's a self contained story about two characters. It isn't some universal truth about developing a successful career vs living a fulfilling romantic life. It might be true for a lot of people, but we can't speak for all 7 billion people in this world. ",

That aspect of the script should have made Chazelle and the people working with him  wince and therefore want to fine tune.\n\nIt would have been better if the script had her finding out about Seb's through a friend, perhaps in a scene where Mia is shown talking about the club to that friend on the phone. I think the presence of the husband was also too visible and jarring, giving an awkward feeling to the last several minutes of the movie. He could have been implied and symbolized by way of the camera showing a photo of the couple with their young daughter, in a frame hanging on the wall or sitting on a table. Or something like that. \n\nThose last several minutes of the movie were extremely important in setting the overall tone of the film, and I wish they had been handled with greater finesse or nuance. \n\nI also had trouble where Mia is shown dancing in the jazz club, her full-length figure highlighted with lighting while surrounded by other patrons of the club (most of them African-American), and Seb playing piano on the other side of the club. The camera darts back and forth between the two, apparently because Damien Chazelle thought that was visually exciting. However, that was another scene that seemed like more of a contrivance than absolutely necessary.",

But the musical numbers are great. It's written based on the Gershwin's music, so while the Gershwins themselves didn't write it, it incorporates songs from other musicals and orchestral compositions they did.",

Yes, we get it, the 21st century notion of romanticising one's dreams but not one's relationships, yes we get it, that whole set backdrop behind the character framing, Emma's acting performance within an acting performance - we get all of it. I didn't need 2 hours of it, and the songs/dances didn't leave much of an impression either. I'm also quite confused as to why Stone is getting so much praise for this.

The Notebook was heavily disliked at 52% by critics, but praised by romance movie fans. While a movie like Skyfall is given 93% on rotten, like it's the savior of all James Bond movies. Of the 75 Oscar winning pictures, roughly 15 of them are romance based movies and of the 75 about half of those are romance musicals. Most movies that receive Oscars are drama's and action movies. Think the Godfather, Ben Hur, Lord of the Rings, Silence of the Lambs, Dances with Wolves, Slumdog Millionaire, Braveheart, Gladiator, Gandhi, Around the World in 80 Days, Spotlight and etc.\n\nI'm not saying you can't dislike the movie. I really don't care if you like or disliked it. I just wanted to share some information on the bias in the critical movie industry. The fact a movie so heavy on the romance and music is beloved by so many is a triumph only succeeded by few musical romance movies in the past.",

Only then, can they start to open up and figure out what kind of person they would actually love.  Being ambitious can be attractive but caution should be heeded. What do we really know about Mia and Seb other than they were ambitious/obsessed with their respective dreams..........and we really don't know anything else. Sure they supported each other, but a real (romantic) relationship has to be based on more than that. Which is why Seb and Mia made no real effort to stay together, my interpretation of that park scene where they parted was a realization that what drew them together was their ambition/dreams and nothing else.",

Others might argue that he did that because he was convinced that, objectively, it would attract more people than the id he wanted to go with originally (which I think was Sebastian's), and therefore he did not actually love Mia. But if we go with that interpretation, then the song he played for Mia at the end, his what-if moment he imagined as he played the song, wouldn't make much sense. His love for her was real. It was romantic. Her love for him was real. It, too, was romantic. His love didn't change, but her's did for another man who somehow took her mind off of Sebastian and brought it to him... perhaps her needs and wants changed after or as she was in the process of \"making it\" in the industry.

Mia was surprised that Seb's club even existed and she seemed satisfied with her life so it seemed there was zero contact from that last conversation when they just decided to go their own ways and see how it worked out.

If they really truly loved each other, they wouldn't have lost touch. She wouldn't have traded him for another guy. The last song/montage in my interpretation is in the frame of fondness for one another but not love. For sure, they were important to each other, but it wasn't true love.

They broke up because they chose to pursue their careers rather than build their relationship. Seb, in hopes of finding a way to open his Jazz bar, joined \"The Messengers\". Believing Mia would had successfully received the role, Seb broke up with her and advised her to pursue acting wholeheartedly, which she did. Their new jobs separated them in distance and time. Neither expected to meet again but they continued to hold a deep affection for each other, which was shown in the final piece. \n\nThe biggest piece of evidence for Mia and Seb being in love was not the scenes at the Planetarium and Seb's bar. It was the music. \"Mia and Seb's Theme\" showed that they were in love. When it first played, Mia was captivated by it. Chazelle showed this by displaying Mia in the center a red neon frame as if she's a living poster, which also highlighted her first steps to stardom. If not for the blue dress, Emma Stone would had been invisible on the screen. \n\nThe second time it played occurred after Mia learned how to listen to Jazz. During her date with Greg, she zoned out and noticed the music being played on the speakers. It was Jazz. She began to think about \"Seb\" and the song, \"Mia and Sebastian's Theme,\" he played at JK Simmons restaurant. Having had enough of the dinner, she left and gleefully ran to the theater for her date with Seb. \n\nFrom a symmetric position, Seb played \"Mia and Seb's Theme\" for the Messengers photoshoot. At that moment he was thinking about Mia and her play. He didn't want to be with Keith and his band, who's music was draining his soul and artistic integrity. Unlike Mia though, he chose to remain and continued his photoshoot, which led to the deterioration of their relationship.\n\nIf Chazelle had portrayed Mia and Seb as \"good, supportive friends,\" he did a horrible job doing so. Chazelle showed Mia and Seb embracing, kissing, in bed together, longing for one another, symmetrically aligned on the poster, and ultimately wishing to redo the past just to be together. If that ain't romance, I don't know what is. \n\n",

            "body": "Thanks for the reply and I empathize with your feelings and thoughts so much. \n\n>Mia seems like someone who is with someone who suits her needs at the moment\n\nI wrote about this in a little more depth in my post above. About how the human heart is fickle, so it clings to and loves an object that most quickly satisfies its inner most needs. And since needs change so frequently for all of us (who really don't what we really need), the heart changes its lover very frequently. Mia's heart showed this condition to a greater degree than Sebastian's.\n\n>If they really truly loved each other, they wouldn't have lost touch\n\nI know right? true love is everlasting. The Apostle Paul writes that love is something that never ends in his letter to the Corinthians in the Bible, and a huge part of loving a person of the opposite sex is staying together physically, mentally, spiritually, which is guaranteed in the promise of marriage (in the ideal scenario). \n\nBut I do remember the Apostle Paul also saying that love is something that does not insist in its own way. It's kind, it's patient, it doesn't envy, it keeps no record of wrongs, it always hopes, trusts, protects, perseveres, and never fails. This is the type of love that Sebastian tried to emulate for Mia, but Mia failed to do. Joining John Legend's band for the sake of Mia and ending the relationship after Mia's audition are the perfect examples of selfless love - though he would want to be together with Mia no matter what, he gives up his want for her good. \n\nThat's why I would disagree with your interpretation of the meaning of the last song. Sebastian played that song out of his love for her. Oh, how less painful would it be for me if I could adopt your interpretation that Sebastian didn't love her at all, but was fond of her accountability in pursuing his dream. That would make the ending so much more digestible and the \"bitter\" of the \"bittersweetness\" feeling would be no more. But, I cannot adopt it - he truly tried to give his all for her and we need to give him and anyone else who does that in our world credit for that. The kind of love that dedicates \"Seb's\", a life-long dream to another person is true love that warrants a response a lot stronger than Mia's.",

But you want to turn this into some kind of opinion argument about the merits of jazz instead of the movie itself. \n\n> Because that's exactly the value judgement that Seb makes. And the movie is clearly on his side in the issue.\n\nI don't think that's clear.  John Legend's character is a good guy that's shown to be rational and well meaning, and he makes a compelling argument against Seb's value judgement when he calls him out on it. He makes such a compelling argument that Seb agrees to join the band after that.  Just because Seb ends up sticking to the brand of jazz that he loves when he opens his club doesn't mean the movie agrees with his musical opinions.  \n\nHaha.  I'm not shitting on you or how you saw the movie.  I'm disagreeing with your opinion, that's it.  ",
