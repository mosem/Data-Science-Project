You can tell the writers were real Batman fans from the sheer number of references.\n\nDoesn't quite have the emotional heft of The Lego Movie, but makes up for it by being funnier and with tons of great action.\n\nI have ONE complaint. There's a scene where Alfred is menaced by Daleks. Alfred is voiced by Ralph Fiennes. How in the HELL could the writers resist having him encounter Voldemort instead, who is also in this movie?"

It was a bit of a wakeup call to how old some of these references are.  \n\nHe doesn't know who Sauron is.  Return of the king is 14 years old  \nHe doesn't know who Voldemort is.  Deathly Hollows part 2 is 6 years old  \nHe doesn't know the Batman 60s references  \nHe doesn't get the Michael Jackson references.  \nHe doesn't know who the Gremlins are.   \n\nSo while this is a kids movie, and a damn good one, it's definitely more of an older kids movie than the Lego movie was.  Yes there were references to older stuff there too, but a quick call-out to Gandalf and the NBA allstars is a little different than making defeating the all seeing eye of Sauron a central part of your climax.\n\nI'm not complaining mind you.  It's a great movie that made me laugh a ton, but I'd say a solid 80% of the jokes require you to be well invested in pop culture that's at least a decade old.  "

I think I enjoyed it more than The Lego Movie. \n\nI loved the cohesiveness of these Lego films two films in. I honestly thought it was going to be all Gotham, all DC characters and then boom it was basically anything Warner Bros owned. Which was fantastic.\n\nSpeaking of the humor; I went to an 11am IMAX showing. Tons of kids. And from the laughter, or I guess lack of in some places, you could really tell it was parents just taking their kid to the movies to entertain them for the morning. Though in my row there was a dad who before the movie was super excited and telling his daughter, who looked to be about 4, a bunch of stuff about Batman. So that was neat.\n\nThe most surprising thing? The story credit: Seth Grahame-Smith. You know, the dude who was supposed to write and direct The Flash. I now really wonder what his Flash film would have been like. Even if they just used his script. "

Somehow it was a premiere. On my way to the bathroom, I ran back into McKay who remembered me from earlier. After the film was done, I got a chance to wish him luck on the sequel and 100% prepared for every LEGO Movie Warner Bros. is ready to throw at me.\n\nHe thanked me, and then gave me very secret information that might blow your ****ing mind.\n\nHe wants to do a LEGO Justice League Movie."

There were so many references to early Batman material, and it always got a laugh from me.\n\nAll the voice work was fantastic, with particular mention to Michael Cera who I'd never have recognized if I didn't know it was him before.\n\nOnly a few jokes didn't hit, but the pacing of the movie doesn't let you linger on them too long."

It was damn awesome. \n\nI liked the 2014 Lego Movie, even though I thought the praise for it was overblown. That one was fun just in the novelty of seeing Legos on the big screen, and just the idea of \"How the hell are they gonna make a movie outta Legos?! Pfft...\" only to take everyone by surprise by actually making it work. But this one took it to that next level where I'm like \"Okay, I see the hype, this one IS that good.\"\n\nIt's a great Batman parody, the best DC superhero movie Warner Bros. has put out in years, and I'd even go as far as to say that it's the best superhero comedy since The Incredibles.\n\nOh yeah, I'm putting it up there with the big dogs. Lemmie found out I'm getting emotional over these damn plastic toys at parts, LOL. But what can I say, man, they really do bring out some relatable, hard-hitting truths in deconstructing the character of Bruce Wanye/Batman, truths that not even some of the heralded live action versions were able to capture. Truths that the aforementioned Incredbiles delved into. It wasn't just all \"LAWLZ zany reference humor\", it had a much bigger heart than I expected (without delving into schmaltz, or stopping the film dead to deliver its message like the 2014 Lego Movie did). Combined with all the homework they did stuffing this film with the clever uses of references and a tight script to bring it all home, this was a GREAT time at the movies and an early contender for my favorites of the year.\n\n...though with how good this movie is, this begs the question: How the HELL are these DCEU movies this bad then? CLEARLY you got folks who know exactly what's wrong with those movies and how to do them right in house, Warner Bros, so here's what ya'll need to do: Just let the creative team behind this do the rest of your DCEU movies from now on. Banish Zack Snyder from the WB lot, disavow David Ayers, lose David Goyer's phone number, and just let Chris McKay and company take it from here. That'd be great, thanks."

As in, since there are no breaks in the action, we are able to assume that twenty on-screen minutes are twenty in-universe minutes, and so on. And herein lies the issue.\n\nIn most movies with good character development and bonding, there is a sizable passage of time. Whether we are there for every step of the journey or not is irrelevant - what matters is we are aware that these characters have spent enough time together to develop a rapport. Indeed, we can see this at work in the original Lego Movie: even though the movie is the same length as this one, the plot takes place over three days, ensuring the characters have time to bond with each other, and us with them. Here, the Batfamily gets together, and within about 15 in-universe minutes (guesstimate, but pretty sure this is accurate) they're suddenly bonded as though they've gone on a huge life-altering quest, when really all they've done together thus far is bomb about in the Batwing a bit.\n\nIt's a fairly fundamental flaw, and one which could have been solved by lopping a few minutes off the big explodey final battle, adding a greater period of time between the gang meeting and declaring themselves buds for life, and generally slowing the whole thing down in places. Would have worked wonders and made that admittedly well-done farewell scene all the sweeter."

It's a straight up parody of Batman, mocking his previous movie iterations and the inherent ridiculousness of a playboy billionaire dressing up as a bat with branded gadgets, while also getting the character right and exploring him in a hyper-meta kind of way. But it also mixes in lessons about family and team work that feel like they're taken straight out of a Disney sob story, which are obviously aimed at a younger audience. This creates a certain imbalance, where the movie tries to be entertaining for all ages but can't really balance the two tones without a noticeable shift from one to the other. This, however, is not a significant fault and doesn't happen too often to be overly distracting. Visually it follows in the footsteps of the first Lego movie with breathtakingly colorful and cinematic animation that often feels like stop motion on speed and is a joy to look at. Not only is this a great animated movie, it's also a hilarious comedy and a cool Batman flick that should be a real crowd pleaser."

The unexpected team of supervillans, especially Voldemort were a great surprise. \n\nThe animation was amazing, much like the original Lego Movie and the jokes were good. The opening riffs from Batman commenting on the Warner Brothers logo and such were a great touch as well.\n\nI'd love a more PG-13 version of the film joke-wise. I feel like Arnett could have easily taken Batman there but I get that the powers that be wanted a financial success and weren't exactly catering to Arnett's core fan base.  "

BATMAN!\" (not sure why) \n\nAnyway, my oldest totally got the concept of the movie was self reflection for Batman, while my 9 year old felt it was about Joker trying to take over the city. \n\nOverall, very funny, and fast paced.

Barbara and Batman spend almost all their interactions being suspicious of one another, with Barbara even straight-up calling Bats out as a sham, and then after exactly *one* battle they're suddenly chumming up and calling themselves 'family' as though they've known and trusted each other for years. \n\nAlso, Alfred completely disappears from the movie for a good half an hour before turning up again just before all the action starts, which felt jarring. And then of course we're suddenly supposed to care about his relationship with Barbara and Dick, characters who he has had little to no interaction with (in Barbara's case, literally none up to this point). Plus they pull the cliched 'wise old man looks like he is about to die but he isn't because this is a kids' movie but we'll still play it up for drama anyway' bit with him which we've seen a million times.\n\nBatman himself had a forced arc as well. In the span of a single scene (the bit where they steal the projector) he goes from seeing Dick as, in his own words, 'expendable' and a disposable means to an end to suddenly feeling fatherly and proud of him...? This didn't gel at all, and the change was so incongruous they clearly decided it would be best to have the computer spell it out for us in insultingly simple terms: \"this emotion is called pride, sir.\" Translation: \"audience, this is a character moment. We didn't convey it very well, so we'll condescendingly narrate it for you.\"\n\nFirst movie did this way better. Emmet and Lucy had genuine chemistry that built up slowly. That beautiful quiet scene near the end in the Kragle vent where they both open their hearts to one another before putting their lives on the line is gorgeous. Nothing like that here. "

            "body": "My thoughts: mostly good jokes, but there were several that fell with a resounding thud (did we really need almost a solid minute of Batman microwaving his lobster and then eating it in total silence?) and the whole thing just moved way too fast, especially given how paperthin the actual plot was. It felt like sherbet was being pumped directly into my brain and I ended up zoning out.\n\nThe first Lego Movie took time to slow down and have the characters interact, building to a wonderfully satisfying emotional climax. Here, it's about 40 minutes' worth of hasty setup, and then the remaining hour just devolves into a bunch of shit blowing up and forced sentimentality that doesn't work; I could have sworn a couple of the 'sad' scenes were copy-pasted from other kids' movies.\n\nMaybe I just saw it with a bad audience, but there was very little laughter throughout - this compared to the roaring crowd I saw the first one with - which I think is telling.\n\nAlso, the pop culture references (not counting those to DC) and product placement were completely and egregiously up the ass here. Don't ask me why Joker rattles off a bunch of obscure romantic comedy titles, or why Batman enjoys *Jerry Maguire* (?!) or why 'Died In Your Arms Tonight' crops up so much on the soundtrack, or why the Flash insisted on shoving an iPhone, complete with huge Apple logo, into our faces on two separate occasions. What's more, the movie committed the cardinal kid-flick sin of making a pee joke (\"your number two needs to go number one\") which the first film tastefully sidestepped doing, a testament to its quality.\n\nOn the plus side, the animation was gorgeous, and the rogues' gallery was incredible. The T-rex from Jurassic Park? Gremlins? Agent Smith? Jaws? All here, and all used well. That rocked.\n\nThe first half an hour or so is a total scream, but there's a real sensation that they passed the screenplay onto the B team after that.\n\nAnd I know this'll get downvoted since the hype is almost unanimous, but there you go.\n\nOverall, I'd say 6/10. Worth one watch."

I didn't know I ever wanted to see Batman fight The Gremlins but there it is in a movie and its lots of fun. I didn't see much of the promotional material for this so I don't know if they spoiled that aspect or not, but for me it was a genuine surprise. \n\nAlso as a huge Batman fan there was just so much fan service. I did find it odd that *a lot* of their references were targeted more towards an older audience. By this I don't mean it was anything explicit in there, but do kids these days know who the Wonder Twins are? Do they know about Clash of the Titans? Hell do they even know Gremlins? I know that I absolutely appreciated this, but I'm not sure how it will land for other people. \n\n\nAlso having nearly every Batman villain in there was a lot of fun even if they didn't get to do much. On that note though, it made me unreasonably happy that Billy Dee Williams (Lando from Star Wars) actually got to play Two Face after all these years. For those who don't know BDW actually played Harvey Dent in the 1989 version of Batman and was contracted to play Two Face in a sequel. When they eventually recast the role with Tommy Lee Jones he was bought out of his contract. "

And it feels like a miss becaue there's stuff they could've played with that would fit in with that - the dynamics of a being a Father and being a Son. "

Seriously, they didn't even try with the Deus Ex Machina in this. There was no hero's journey, there was no motivation for anything Batman did, there was no real crisis or redemption for the main character. \n\nRegarding the comedy, it was pretty great. The joke about all the actual awful Batman villains (Gentleman Ghost, Condiment King) were gold. Batman saying \"no no no\" on the floor and stairs was gold. All the references to no one being allowed to die in Batman were gold (\"Hooray! Non-lethal!\"). But the jokes weren't enough to save the rest of the movie in my view. \n\nWhile I'd give the first LEGO Movie a resounding \"A\", this one gets a solid \"C+\" from me.

It wasnt near as clever as the Lego movie, where Chris Pratt absolutely nailed the main characters voice. I found Arnetts batman voice incredibly annoying by the 1st hour of constantly hearing it. Also, we aren't supposed to like Batman here? I get that it's a parody but I found that it only took away from the movie and didn't add to it. The plot was incredibly predictable (more so than most kid movies, which is saying something) and I feel that the amount of money they spent on voice actors should have been spent on a better script. Overall, I am disappointed and do not intend to see any other Lego movies."

Batman has to learn to work together and not be a loner. Gee I never saw that plot used before in a Batman story. Oh wait I have. Constantly. The ironic thing is the only reason this plot gets used again and again in Batman stories is because writers and fans always push for him to work alone no matter what, e.g. Arkham Games, Nolan Bat Trilogy, etc. And the bit about Joker wanting Batman to admit they have a special relationship? Done to death. Hell they did an entire series in the comics dedicated to that story called Death of the Family. \n\nOh dear me I've disagreed with the overwhelming majority view and am being downvoted for it.

Those did kind of put my smile away for a little bit. Also, the fact that the bad guy team were a really weird mix of famous villians and rather b-rate ones like gremlins? It didn't make much sense until you realised that it was all just stuff Warner Bros.-owned, which is a shame as it would have been awesome to see some bad guys like Darth Vader in there.\n\nThere was a lot of stuff I loved though, like the jabs at other Batman films, the jabs at Suicide Squad, and Bane. The animation was mind-blowing, and the first act or so from the film was grin-inducing. Maybe I'm just being picky, but I really loved The LEGO Movie and don't want it to turn into another blockbuster franchise with scripts that don't have much time being spent on them, or studio executives getting too much power.\n\nI did enjoy The LEGO Movie more than The LEGO Batman Movie, but I thought they were both great and I would watch it a second time."

Nobody is willing to crack a smile, lighten the tone, or leverage the tropes of the characters to build something better. \n\nLego Batman works because it builds on some elements everyone has thought about the character, but would never make it into the main films. He's a single dude that insists on living alone in a massive mansion, who never manages to actually eliminate the threats that he swears to protect the city from. By joking about those elements of the mythos, the film is able to tell a unique & charming Batman story."

While it does look to have a similar humor and style, it's definitely more directed towards the younger generation. The reason why I say this is because I have absolutely no idea what Ninjago was until seeing this trailer, but my younger nieces do and seem to be more excited for that movie than any of the other Lego Movies. But The first Lego Movie and The Lego Batman movie appeal to adults who grew up playing with Lego's and watching Batman in numerous forms as well as appealing to young kids who are currently going through a Lego play phase. Just my speculation anyways, I have no desire to see the Ninjago movie personally. Maybe when it comes to Netflix or something, but I expect I'd be a little lost watching it either way."

Like its still a children's movie, and expecting some marvel of storytelling and scriptwriting beyond that of what children 6-12 would like is silly. Where it held my attention and I got my entertainment value as a Batman fan was from the self parody of the Batman franchise. [The relationship between the Joker and Batman being synonymous with a romantic relationship is great because it so closely mirrors the relationship between the two in more serious movies and shows. All the little callbacks to the original series, particularly the ongoing joke of batman and joker being 70+ years old, are hilarious because they poke at the quirks and continuity issues of the series in a fun and playful way.](#spoiler) \n\nSaying LEGO batman isn't a good movie because it was mostly old Batman references is like saying Galaxy Quest isn't a good movie because it was all old Star Trek references. If you aren't into the series no shit you aren't going to enjoy it but for all of us who are its about as perfect a Batman comedy as we could have hoped for. "

People are already off on their sense of what is average. It also seems that people are more likely to stick to either end of the scale or the middle, ignoring some numbers in between. I rarely hear someone call something a 3 or a 7.  \nNow a scale of 1-7 has an average of 4, extremes of 1 and 7, and also provides options that are close to those options but lean one way or the other. It's also nice to accompany your options with a phrase or sentence that further clears up what they mean. E.G. 5- Better than average, Enjoyable, or Good.  \nLast random note. Please include if your extremes mean perfection. I will almost never use a 1 or 10 unless there is a description to clarify. I couldn't imagine a perfect pizza, but maybe you just made the most delicious pizza I've ever eaten!"

They are both CRAZY psychotic killers and somehow they find love in each other. I LOVE when Joker shows that he cares for her. I love seeing him miss her and I love it when they're a power couple. Harley belongs to Joker and Joker loves Harley, that's something people now a days are slowly forgetting and instead choose to look at the abusive side that some writers go with. Suicide Squad offered a different take on their relationship and it was AMAZING!!!! It showed Joker caring for Harley just like how she cares for him, it showed them as a power couple just like how I love to see them be.Yet some people were upset that they didn't see the Joker abuse Harley? I mean seriously why?? They wanna see abuse? They wanna see a woman be hurt by a man?? To me it doesn't make sense and to be honest I think those people are just messed up. I prefer Joker loving Harley then hurting her. Sooooo yeah that's some reasons why lol."

If they wanted to, they could have games and movies that use both Marvel and DC characters, but when it came to LEGO Dimensions, they decided it was best to include Disney in their decisions since Disney has (had) a competing game, and they considered giving them the go-ahead on Marvel characters but decided against it. I imagine that set a precedent so that LEGO shelves Marvel characters for movies and games, but that can't last forever. Once both of these houses play out their respective franchises a bit more, I'll bet we get a LEGO Marvel vs DC movie/game. "

Both have their own world kits and several other smaller ones. So featuring them in the movie would make sense from a marketing standpoint. It isn't like the writers just decided to use these villains because it would some how make the movie flow better. They took the best out of what Lego had licenses for and threw them in, and several are the big id IPs that are prominently featured for Lego Dimensions. \n\nThe only reason I even made the joke that it was an ad was because after the movie both me and my friend really wanted to buy Lego Dimensions stuff. \n\nTL Dr: The movie is an ad in the same way the Lego Movie was. It made Legos relevant for a generation of kids who didn't give a shit about them. And that's not even an ad persay. But it doesn't mean that the movie wasn't good.  "

Then you can basically buy physical DLC in the form of Lego sets that you can use in the game, like Ghostbusters, Knight Rider, The Simpsons, and Adventure Time. Some of these are just the characters themselves and some are actual expansions that allow you to play in those worlds.\n\nI was frankly surprised by how much detail they put in, like the music and actual voices from the franchises, and they clearly had a lot of fun making this game. For example, there's a scene where GLaDOS (from Portal) gets into an argument with HAL 9000, and it's so bizarre to witness."

The rest of the DC ones are straight-to-video and purchasable on DVD/streaming, and the LEGO Star Wars ones are streaming-purchasable only, with a couple of them available on DVD. Of them, the LEGO Star Wars ones are IMO the weakest; all of the superhero ones are *excellent*.\n\nIf you're a fan of superhero crossovers, there are also really great separate crossovers of the Marvel superheroes and Star Wars with Phineas and Ferb. Those are on Netflix, both in the fourth season."

You've been brought under the wings (ha) of the city's most badass vigilante.  You have a few disagreements and almost die.  You're also both single.  Not a stretch to imagine sex would happen somewhere in there.  I think the problem is more that it felt kind of wrong, afterwards it kind of felt like a mistake and as the audience I felt like I needed a shower.  That doesn't mean it's bad storytelling, that's what makes drama matter.  One of my favorite parts of the film was the conversation she had with her friend about it after, where she persisted that it didn't mean anything but you can tell she's wrestling with it.  I think most fans were just like, ew, gross, that's not supposed to happen!  But in reality, it probably would, and there would be awkward feelings afterwards. Life isn't perfect and people make mistakes.  That one ended up having pretty significant consequences."

Two vastly different things. \n\nThe parts of the movie with Joker were needless, weak, and forced. \n\nThe movie would have benefited greatly from having either a lot less of the Joker, a radically different Joker, or an entirely different climax instead. \n\nOh, and the intended climax of the movie may very well Batman saying \"I hate you\" to the Joker. But it's probably one of the weakest parts of the entire film. It doesn't come close to the emotional or narrative intensity that you get earlier where Batman needs to trust the others as they are [on the Batwing (under attack by Gremlins)](#spoiler), or just a short while later, where [Batman is willing to accept the consequences of his bad actions by going to the phantom zone](#spoiler).  \n\nThe entire Joker-Batman dynamic in this movie was needless, weak and forced by comparison to the Batman-Robin or even Batman-Alfred dynamic. \n\n"
