If China wanted to jump start their industry on the international blockbuster level, Zhang Yimou was the perfect pick. \n\nIt also wasn't worth the whitewashing/white savior controversy, since the film is way more about how savage Westerner Matt Damon is saved by Chinese communism who then helps the cause rather than Damon himself being the one who saves China himself.

            "body": "I saw this movie this movie about 2 month ago, and i was waiting for US release date so that the movie can be discussed here. (Living in China currently, and most movies are released a while after US release, so most times, by the time i watched the movie, discussions are already over. \n\nSo lets talk about the movie. Brief and Simple. \n\nFirst, plot/story. Very generic storyline. Monsters come. Fight. Monsters go. Improve technique. Fight again. Win. main characters kiss. That is a very basic story line. (Dont know if this is a spoiler, cause everyone should know this anyways even if they never watched the movie)but still on the positive way, it had a simple storyline. Storys weren't dragging on and not much useless scenes were included. Audience didnt really get bored. \n\nSecond, Action. Scale of the movie was tremendous and was very impressive. Solely looking at action, i would give it a 8/10. Also, scale of the war was amazing. The great wall was recreated at a massive scale, and the hot air ballon scene in the night was (unrealistic but) beautiful. However, what really made me cringe was the bungee jumping warriors (idk what they are called) but that just cracked me out. I mean wtf is that suppose to be. Are the fishing the monsters with warriors as a bait? But was still cool, looking at them jump down. \nIf tha action scenes were a bit more violent, imo it could have expressed the monsters more violent and make war more realistic. I kept imaging World war Z when I saw the monsters climbing walls, but after the movie i found out that both movies were from same film production crew. \n\nI dont know what to feel about the 3-arrow shooting scene. It was cool but i don't really know if it really fit in to the movie well. \n\nJing tian (Commander Lin)'s acting IMO was not so good. Just like my mom said, her acting compared to Matt Damon, who is an amazing actor, needs more practice.Among chinese actors, Andy Lau's acting and english, both were the best. The monsters design, at first really disgusted me. I was expecting a really cool monster and *bam*. WELL, but atfter the movie, their ugly appearance i think expressed their cruel behavior in nature more affectively. I somehow ended up disliking the Queen' design even more. \n\nInteresting fact: \n\nJing Tian (Commander Lin) will be appearing again Kong: Skull Island.\n\nThe Great Wall is a Chinese movie to use the most budget. \n\nLu han use to be (would anyone clarify this info) a member of korean idol group EXO. \n\nThe emperor is from a group called TFBoys.\n\nThanks for reading this crappy review lol\n",

Some really nice cinematography and production design, particularly the costumes. \n\n--some nicely done fight sequences, although it looked like they blew their creative wad on the first fight sequence and the rest were just ok. \n\n--I liked that there was obvious sexual tension between Matt Damon and the General but they never actually go anywhere into a tacked on romance. Made the General a stronger female lead. \n\n**THE BAD**\n--the inconsistency of Matt Damon's accent. At times he sounded typically American. At times it sounded like he was *trying* to do an Irish brogue. At his worst he sounded like a white actor trying to do a Native American (think Tonto from Lone Ranger)\n\n--the inconsistency of Matt Damon's eyes. I swear there were a few scenes where it looked like they did some kind of make up effect to give him slightly Asian eyes. But then there were other scenes where he had the permanent look of surprise that one has when they've had a bad eye brow lift. (I guess he's had work done?)  And then there were times when he looked \"normal\". \n\n--the final show down scene with the queen lizard was almost a shot for shot recreation of the final showdown from Independence Day II. \n\n--The magic rock quality that the magnet took on at the end. When there were a couple dozen lizards at the door of the tower and the strategist whips around and holds the magic rock up to the door I actually busted out laughing. ",

It seems like all the work went into designing cool armor and siege weapons, and they didn't think of what the soldiers would actually be *fighting* until the last minute. I'm also not fond of the \"kill the boss and all the minions are somehow disabled\" solution, it always seems like a copout.\n\nI would've liked to see more acrobatics, martial arts, and stunt work. Those were always the strong points in the movie when we got them.\n\nThe plot was pretty bare-bones but it's to be expected. The action blockbusters that do well in China look cool and don't have complex stories, so it's pretty good in that regard.\n\nI just thought it was cool to get a big action blockbuster with a unique Ancient Chinese aesthetic, as opposed to sci-fi or European fantasy. So as far as that goes, I enjoyed it and could recommend it.",

The last half of the movie how ever while cool was the weaker aspect of it and the point i started checking my phone.\n\n\nAs for anyone who would say this is a white savior film I would disagree. Other than bringing the magnet and coming up with the whale hunting idea Matt Damon's character does just about as much or as little as everyone elses. Plus remember this was a Chinese film with a Chinese Producer made by a Chinese studio for a Chinese audience. So I really don't think white savior would count in this instance. \n\nSo good B grade action film to watch at home when you have nothing else to do. ",

I think it added to the enormity of the wall in certain scenes.\n\nI am critical towards the opinion that this movie is somehow whitewashing or plays the white savior trope, though I understand why some feel that way because of how it's marketed in the US. The chinese poster's for the Great Wall tend to place the cast on more equal terms, unlike the US posters that have Matt Damon front and center.\n\nThere are criticisms to this movie, but I think the outrage for Matt Damon being in this movie is a bit misplaced, and I think that energy would be better spent celebrating and sharing examples of some great Chinese films. I appreciated the fact they decided to keep several dialogue scenes in Chinese with subtitles, instead of having the entire film in English. I hope this continues for future productions. I don't know if Yimou had to fight to keep subtitles in, but if he did, I'm glad. \n\nOverall, the $11.29 IMAX ticket was worth it, for me at least.",

Reading the comments on Reddit, I went in expecting Dragon Blade or Warcraft quality but it was much better.\n\nThe first few moments I was apprehensive. There was a short chase we'd all seen before, then some fireplace banter, and the make or break moment where the Matt Damon and Pedro \"Oberyon\" Pascal first meet the Chinese at the Great Wall. It could've gone really cheesy and nationalistic but it didn't and soon we were just watching the story about a mercenary and his friend happening upon a crazy situation.\n\nThere were many things it did right and I'll jot each one down.\n\nThe relationship between Matt and Pedro was the highlight for me. Like Edge of Tomorrow, it's a shame the commercials didn't feature more of the banter between them because we were laughing each time they were together. Pedro Pascal definitely has a future in action comedies and Matt Damon's accent could pass as Brad Pitt's brother in Snatch.  Also, for a blockbuster, the characters were well defined and rich with conflict.\n\nThe visuals were absolutely amazing. Someone compared it to watching the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics and it's a good comparison. You'll get to see the Great Wall, inventive battles on it, the monster cgi was actually not distracting and look better than World War Z's zombies, the costumes are gorgeous and the colors help to organize the different groups of soldiers. Please don't watch it online because its visuals are such eyecandy.\n\nFor anyone worried about Chinese propaganda, the message of the movie is cooperation and trust over greed. There are both bad and good Western and Chinese characters. I never got the sense they were good or bad because of where they were from but because of who they were. Both Western and Chinese characters kicked major ass and equally saved the day. If scenes of Chinese people kicking monster ass unsettles you, then it's just you.\n\nThe marrying of Western and Chinese elements were really well done. We got a tight Western structure and the most Chinese things invariably were the dressings on it. So there's really sweet archery from Matt Damon and kung fu and Chinese battle tactics, Lord of the Rings-type pacing and suspense and monsters and a Chinese Forbidden City-like capital. My favorite scene was the singing and lantern scene because it was very Chinese and appreciated the filmmakers respecting us enough not to cut it.\n\nI'm a big Hong Kong cinema fan so seeing Matt Damon and Andy Lau together was awesome (they starred in their respective versions of Infernal Affairs).\n\nSo those are my two cents on TGW. It's a fun quality blockbuster that I wholeheartedly recommend.  Grade: A.",

For a movie that was being bragged about as the movie expense Chinese movie of all time the monster lizards looked really lame and the special effects had a very cheap look to it at times.\n\nMatt Damon and Jing Tian are the two leads of this movie and they are definitely co-leads in the film. Jing Tian is incredibly charismatic and beautiful and incredible as the leader of the idless army. I definitely want to see her in more films. Looks like Hollywood knows how good she is since she is also in the new King Kong movie and Pacific Rim 2. Look forward to seeing her.\n\nThe non-Chinese characters weren't as great. Damon was fine though I wasn't sure what kind of accent he was going for. Not saying it was bad, but I just didn't know what it was supposed to be. Maybe its my own ignorance. \n\nWillem Dafoe is completely wasted in the film. He's barely present in the film and nothing he does holds any baring on the plot. He just tries to steal the black powder and randomly gets captured and blown up off screen. \n\nPedro Pascal only fares a little better. He should have a bigger role and he makes every scene he's in better which makes it even worse when his character disappears in the 3rd act. I thought for sure he'd change his mind and join Damon in the final battle but instead you find out at the end of the movie he's been put in prison and then Damon bails him out. Should have had him in the final battle. Pascal saving Damon in the middle of the movie and helping him capture a monster was easily the best scene in the movie imo.\n\nBattle scenes are okay but they could have been a lot better. At times it felt like World War Z with giant lizards instead of a war/monster movie. The scene with Damon and Pascal fighting alone while trying to capture one monster was probably the best scene in the movie. Needed more boots on the ground combat scenes like that.\n\n6/10.

I thought it would more than likely be a bit of a dumb popcorn action/fantasy movie and that's pretty much what it is. Does what it says on the tin! And I think having low expectations allowed me to enjoy this one for what it was.\n\nThe visuals in this film are absolutely gorgeous. The use of colour and the cinematography was a treat. If you've seen the director's previous work (Hero, House of Flying Daggers etc) then you know that is to be expected. Some of the shots in this movie were breathtaking! I watched in 2D but I bet it looks even better in IMAX.\n\nThe film is the most expensive Chinese film ever made and it shows through the production design and scale. The sets were stunning and you could tell a lot of practical effects went into this film which I'm a big fan of.\n\nThe world building was great. The weapons, fighting styles, character designs, costumes, gadgets were all very original and it all came together quite nicely.\n\nThe action was absurdly fun too. Very entertaining and they handled the big battle sequences well. Some interesting choreography and camera work. Probably the best thing about the film.\n\n\nWhere this film fails (and why it will get a LOT of bad reviews) is the writing, plot and character development. Because there is pretty much none in either case. This is what lets it down massively. I genuinely had a fun time watching it though.\n\n\nThe dialogue is cheesy as hell, the plot is as basic as they come and the characters were all very one dimensional and bland. I'd say Damon's character was one of the most bland roles he's ever played. There was literally no character development whatsoever and it was lacking heart.\n\n\nI think with a film such as this where they have to cater to both the Asian and Western markets it's easy to play it safe. And that's what they've done here. It will probably make a shit ton of money which is great for the Chinese film industry as a whole though.\n\nAlso a lot of people seem to be hating on this film (even before they've seen it) because it has a white male lead character. First of, he's not portrayed as some white saviour type. Secondly, the part wouldn't work if it wasn't a westerner (which is why the part was written that way) And thirdly, having Matt Damon in it will make people go see it. Which equals more money. It's not rocket science.\n\nFew other points:\nMatt Damon's accent - what the hell is even going on there? Like seriously. Fucking awful. \nWillem Dafoe - not really much point to his character at all and his motivations were non existent\nCGI - Could have been better\nAll in all, I'd say it's worth a watch if you want a film that's just gonna entertain you for a couple hours and not do much beyond that. Go in with low expectations and you will probably enjoy it.",

            "body": "**The Good:**\n\n- Some really gorgeous cinematography and production designs.  The color coded ranger armors and various anachronistic contraptions are nice too look at.\n\n- Related to the above, there are some reasonably cool, well done action sequences to be seen.\n\n- Damon and Oberyn have a fun buddy chemistry.  I'd watch these two stumble into more movies.  Maybe they run afoul of Djinn in Arabia.  Or they stay at an inn back in England and it turns into a murder mystery/rom com.\n\n- Commander 'Mulan's Life Goal Achieved' is very pretty.\n\n- There's no cringe-inducing propaganda that I noticed.  Damon's character arc is a pretty standard selfish rogue-selfless hero to defend humanity, it's not about him embracing the Central Government, communism, forgiving the Emperor for genocide or anything like that. \n\n- Nice score and sound design. \n\n**The Bad:**\n\n- Some of the sequences have ambitions that outpace was the production can convincingly sell.\n\n- A lot of the CG looks a bit second rate.  But at least it's only second rate, not third.  And thankfully, most of the worst-looking shots are kept brief.\n\n- Matt Damon is doing some kind of accent...a little bit.  I think he might have been trying to sound Scottish, but I'm honestly not sure.  It's not as gloriously awful as Jessica Chastin's Groundskeeper Willie brogue from The Huntsman: Winter's War, instead it's very underplayed.\n\n- Kill the boss, the whole army dies.  Ugh!  We're still using this trope in 2017?  People were groaning aloud back in 2000 when it was used in The Phantom Menace, and when it showed up in Avengers in 2012, and however many lesser films as well.   It's lazy and annoying.  The moment the introduce the idea of the command queen you can guess how the war will be won.\n\n- Some of the action beats are just too goofy, like they could belong in an episode of Xena.\n\n- Willem Dafoe is under-used.\n\n- Plot hole involving the Tao-Tei's weakness, since it appears that a 900 year old battle report already explained it.  So why haven't they attempted to use it before?\n\n- The General of the Wall is under-used.\n\n**The Meh:**\n\n- Damon is rather bland in the scenes he doesn't share with Oberyn.\n\n- Creature design is hovers between interesting an uninspired. I think there should have been more variety among them.  Maybe a big armor tusked-version to smash into the wall, for instance.  I still thought the Tao-Tei resembled Outlander's Moorwen, so I chuckled a bit when it was revealed that they came from outer space.  I wonder if the \"meteor\" was actually a ship.\n\n- Commander 'No Way Her Boobs are Actually Big Enough to Fill Out that Armor' isn't terrible, but she isn't very captivating as an actress, either.\n\n- The plot is serviceable but by-the-numbers all the way.  SyFy has had lots of similar movies with people fighting dragons, zombies, aliens, or what-have you various time periods, there's probably a computer that spits out these scripts by now.  This just has more competent acting and and a real budget to go with it.          \n\n**The Missed Opportunities:**\n\n- Touch on what the Mongols know about the Tao-Tei.  Maybe they're the reason they developed a nomadic horse-based culture, so they can stay the hell away from them!\n\n- They could have had a general idd Tso cook one of the dead creatures and say \"it tastes like chicken\".\n\n- Show the monster hive!  We only the green-tinted mountain in the distance, neither character no camera over goes inside.\n\n- There's a scene where Damon is obviously supposed to kiss Commander 'Female Blue Ranger', or at least try to kiss her and she says they can't because of duty/custom/whatever.  But the scene just ends with them talking and there's no resolution at all.\n\n- It would have been nice to hear what the purple and gold corps were.  Black was foot soldiers, so purple was...other foot soldiers?  Gold was cavalry?  Were they different from the engineer guys who were mostly shirtless but seemed to have gold on too?\n\n- Somebody should have explained what Tao-Tei means.",

Matt Damon (How the fuck did he get roped into this?) tries a terrible Irish (?) accent in the first third of the movie.  Jing Tian is nice to look at but relatively wooden, though she can certainly cry on cue.  Willem Dafoe is just here for his check.  Pedro Pascal and Damon have a nice chemistry that made me chuckle a couple of times.\n\nThe directing is terrible, especially in an early battle when they encounter the monster for the first time.  I get that they don't want to show the monsters yet but the editing is a confusing mix of cuts and quick edits that are totally disorienting.  The way they fight the monsters is equal parts believable medieval warfare and \"shit that looks cool even though it makes no sense\" like the pole divers and the \"close combat\" soldiers in their shield phalanx who I never saw do anything except get owned.

The romance wouldn't have been better but it would have made sense, why would Matt Damon had help them? No reason was given, he had been a mercenary all his life then he meets this battalion and suddenly he gets chummy with them, no emphasis or even reason was given on why specifically this battalion gets to be on Matt's good side, it just is and it's a weak reason.\n\nThey talked about trust but nothing noteworthy happened that turned Matt Damon into this noble trusting character that want to save people and trust another. The friendship they were trying to make was weak and unsubstantial, they talk, they were on a board and she ask him trust her to jump. About it, if you tell me he wants to score that pussy, sure [but he failed anyways](#spoiler) then what suprises me the most was when he [fucking free this Spanish guy who betrayed him in place of taking the money, what? This is weak because there is no thought process in this, you can say he is trusting of good people now but this guy he is with is like a scumbag](#spoiler)\n\nIt was a weak connection and made no sense. The plot was generic and about a bunch of monsters that's going to destroy the world, design is okay by a very low standard and some of the mechanisim like dropping spearwoman into the battle made no sense at all, they immediately die before they are even able to make a dent in the monster's attacking formation so what was the point of even doing that? It would have been a better plan to just pour oil down and burn them, or dig a hole filled with spikes around the wall. Either way, the film was average at best, entertained me a little bit with the servicable fight scene but everything else was just mediocrity to shit.",

            "body": "For those of you who are upset that this show is whitewashing, please stop. Like seriously, if you are not Asian or that you are an Asian American, please stop assuming you're speaking on behalf of the rest of the Asians. You're only making yourself look bad.\n\nI'm Asian, watched this since January from where I live, and I can never understand why people say this show was a complete whitewash or that it had too many white savior elements. Believe or not, this show received pretty good ratings in China, because it was one of the major films to have made it to the international screens. People need to understand Matt Damon's character was a mercenary, he came to China in search of black powder, that was how he slowly integrated in to the story. He didn't arrive at China by chance and was suddenly crowned as the savior. He was respected because he took down a Tao Tie with ease and he had a pre-encounter with these creatures. He came across the idless Order because he and Pedro's character were attempting to escape the Mongol bandits. \n\nAnd I wished people'd stop hating on the show for being one-dimensional in terms of character development. It's a fantasy war film, if you wanted deep characters then half of the movie would have just been talking, which means you're looking at the wrong film. It would also mean half of it would just be like The Edge of Tomorrow, repetitive and utterly boring. Sure, we got to see Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt kick ass but that show was draggy as heck. The Great Wall's entire focus was on the war itself, which meant everyone had little time for chatter. And mind you, the show was 2 hours, there's only so much the film can put in. \n\nBy no means this show was extremely good, but you guys are giving it far less credit that it deserves. You have to admit, the show paid attention to details and really took time to elaborate certain elements, like how each army squads were formed for very specific purposes. One of the most iconic part of the movie were the Crane Corps, as much as their strategic warfare made zero sense, and it really highlighted the significance of these animals in a Chinese literature. For example, Cranes are graceful & elegant, Eagles are swift and deadly, Bears are courageous and strong, Tigers are ruthless and powerful & Deers are united and intelligent. Had it been any other war film, the directors probably wouldn't have given a damn about these details and probably would have left it to the viewers to figure it out themselves. This is one of the reasons why The Great Wall stood out, every unimportant character got some screen time and you really get to see the show from a holistic view.\n\nDefinitely, the film fell flat after the first major battle, but it still included a ton of action scenes. It was flat but not predictable which meant you were kept in suspense. And to be honest, the events of the film transitioned smoothly so viewers could have an easier time understanding the flow of the film. The CGI effects are pretty standard, but good enough. After all, how can you expect much from a CGI film? At least the creatures didn't seem fake. The Tao Tie design wasn't probably the best it could be, but it was pretty standard for a film creature. They were four legged, vicious and killed soldiers, that's what matters. \n\nThe script was bland but honestly, half of the Chinese cast don't speak English (save for Eddie Peng who received English education in Canada but he wasn't part of the main cast anyway). It definitely had to be simplified because you have to be mindful that there are non-English speaking audiences who were watching the film. Basic at best but it was effective. \n\nIf y'all learned to stop judging the film from a whitewashing perspective and really just enjoy the show as is, the show is easily a 6/10, 7/10 at most. It's slightly above average, and a film that I believe everyone wouldn't have trouble watching it a second time. Personally, it's one of those films that would appeal to certain people, and perhaps a film that would fit perfectly well as a summer tv program. Anytime you've run out films to watch, just take this out and to entertain your crowds then put it back in to your collection of blu rays when you don't need it. \n\nThe only thing that really stood out in the film was how Jing Tian's acting was pretty mediocre. As it stands, 40% of the film time belonged to her due to nepotism. For those of you wondering how a nobody like Jing Tian gets so much attention and  opportunity to star in films like Kong and Pacific Rim, it's partly due to nepotism because she's the girlfriend of the CEO in Wanda Group. Ask anyone in China about Jing Tian and that's the answer you get mostly. But Jing Tian had always made a id for herself by starring in action films. Despite the absence of martial arts in her background, she really puts in effort to perform all her stunts and had the opportunity to star alongside Donnie Yen in a Special ID. \n\nBut really, as far the show goes, it's easily a solid B- or B. And people aren't giving the show the necessary credit it deserves. If you happen to like The Great Wall and probably have some questions surrounding the elements of the show, you could always pick up a copy of The Great Wall: The Last Survivor, a comic that's recently released as a way to promote the release of the film in the States. The comic takes place 60 years before The Great Wall and AFAIK, reviews about the comic was great and it earned an 8/10. In fact, I'm waiting for mine to arrive this coming Wednesday.\n\nThe only thing I'm really curious is why the Crane army had to jump off walls to spear the creatures. I never quite understood its significance from a strategic perspective. I mean if you wanted to prevent the creatures from scaling the wall, they could have always utilized the mechanic blades but alas, it didn't happen. And the Deer armies were pretty useless as far as storytelling went. One would have thought they'd serve as the front line/cannon fodders and expected them to be actual cavalries, but all they really do is march around and die easily. And to that someone mentioning how it was gruesome to see those female soldiers being devoured, I felt the same way too. Funny how the male soldiers all experienced a quick death but then we had to see female soldiers struggling helplessly as the creatures bit them despite it being a war film. But I guess it had to happen since IT IS related to Jing Tian's character anyway.\n\nTL;DR - Lower your expectations, stop having the whitewashing perspective in mind and this show is easily a solid B. Music was great too. \n\n",

And I ended up actually having a lot of fun watching it!\n\n\n\nLoved the fight scenes a lot, especially when they're down at the war zone level at the foot of the wall. And I actually got some chills during the final battle, when the queen realized what tower they were in and sent all the creatures toward it, haha! Again, it might just be that I was completely expecting a crap movie.. but I kinda want to see that again! Maybe the surprise of it being decent would wear off and I could look at it with my critical eye. Something that really stuck out to me was the overall feeling of the wall.. especially during the first time we get a glimpse of the inside, when the guy is running past all the soldiers shouting. I absolutely love how they made it feel actually old and real. I don't know. I swear I could feel it though, like when I'm walking in an old castle and imagining what it would have been like to live in it back in the day. Definitely enjoyed it.",

I'm very curious to know what the overall reaction was in China, and I've been learning a lot reading from people's comments in this thread. I saw the segment of the link you posted with \"China's Oprah\", and she made a lot of great points that gives the idea that the film wasn't unanimously admired. I really appreciated her comments from the perspective about china's culture and how it will be represented. The way in which she admits, if the movie was called anything else besides \"the GREAT wall\" she would just concede it as a popcorn flick, but the fact that it contains the word Great in the title is something that is very important for her, and it is something I would not have otherwise considered had you not shared that link, so thank you!\n\nAlso her line about what ever happened to Zhang Yimou's spirit who made \"The Story of Qui Ju\" I was like damn!

            "body": "Hi Dargomir. First of all, I want to thank you for your response to my comment, and for taking the time to share your view of the film. :) \n\nLet me also say that I agree with you're underlying point that the \"white savior\" trope can have harmful impacts whenever a culture's history or story is exploited in order for a white protagonist (or any non-member of that group's history for that matter) to come in and save the day in place of that group's shared history--especially when it is done to make a buck. And since movies are communicated to massive audiences, it has the dangerous potential to spread a \"single story\" of that group's history which may be incomplete or flat out inaccurate. \n\nIt's why I enjoy seeing the films of other countries, because I get the chance to see how they tell their stories, how they perceive certain events to have happened, and their reactions to it. It allows me to empathize with the stories of their own heroes. I'm reminded of Zhang Yimou's \"The Story of Qiu Ju\", where the main protagonist in that film is a pregnant wife who has traveled a long ways from her village, and is persistent in pursuing justice for her husband's injury even if it means putting up with a bureaucracy and other people's demands encouraging for her to go back home.\n\n I mentioned earlier how I am critical towards the opinion that The Great Wall somehow whitewashes or plays the white savior trope. I think a valid argument could be made for the white savior trope, and I would be open to hearing it. I think these types of discussions are important given the history of US cinema, and its examples found throughout it.\n\nHowever, as it pertains to The Great Wall I still conclude that the outrage towards Matt Damon's presence in the movie is misplaced, and that by having Matt Damon in the movie, it somehow whitewashes the story. I do not intend to convince you of my position, but rather to clarify my reasoning behind my conclusion. If you disagree with my reasoning, that is wonderful and I would love to continue having this discussion with you or anyone else who sees the film differently. :) \n\nI think it helps to clarify what we mean by whitewashing. In the context of Matt Damon's casting in the film, the premise is that by having a white actor (in this case Matt Damon) cast in a non-white character role, you are thereby whitewashing that element of the story. I would agree with you if that was the case, especially if Matt Damon was cast as one of the generals leading the soldiers on the wall or the emperor of China. \n\nHowever, given what we see and hear in the film, Matt Damon's role  as a character is meant be a mercenary which serves as a contrast to one of the main female soldiers who is fighting for something beyond just money. There is a scene in which she asks Damon's character who he has fought for, and he mentions how he has fought for many 'flags\" from Spain, to France, and even the Pope (we presume he's talking about the crusades). As I understand it, Damon's character is a mercenary from the west who has been paid, or will be paid if he can manage to find black powder and return it to the west. Unless you are suggesting that this role should have been played by a non-white actor, I don't see how this is whitewashing a role.\n\nAs for the white savior trope, I'm not entirely convinced. For a while, towards the end of the film, (although the movie plot-wise is very thin) Damon's character is unsuccessful in killing off the queen. As cheesy as the image may seem, it was both Damon's character and Commander Lin who took down the queen together. I think she was just as active in saving her own country, if not more considering she had an effect on Damon's character decision to stay and fight rather than run away for the pursue of money. It's almost a weird reversal on the white savior trope in a way.\n\nCould this film have been made without Matt Damon's role in it? Definitely. I'm sure you could just have a monster film about the great wall, with nothing but Chinese characters and actors. Could the mercenary have been from elsewhere besides the west? Sure. I don't see why mercenaries wouldn't exist in other parts of the world at the time. I'm sure their were probably even mercenaries acting within the East region. It would still be a valid way to tell a story, but it would be a different story than the one that Zhang Yimou decided to tell. \n\nWhich brings me to my last point. If Zhang Yimou, a Chinese film director, had decided to whitewash his own country's history, I would be one the first to be disappointed. For Zhang Yimou, (who was banned from making films from his own country for a period of time for depicting a film [To Live] that was critical of communist policies) to consider whitewashing certain elements of Chinese history would be surprising and unlike him given his previous filmography. Obviously The Great Wall is not a documentary, but I think Zhang Yimou has a vested interest in portraying Chinese roles respectfully in a way that is accurate and faithful at least to his own understanding of his culture's current and past history. I think more than anything it is the people of China who would feel the most betrayed if their own history or culture had been whitewashed. Why would Zhang Yimou be any different?\n\nIf you feel I have misunderstood or mischaracterized your point of view, feel free to let me know. :) I thank you for taking the time to read this far, and I encourage others to celebrate stories and experiences in films made beyond the US. As I understand it, this film was a co-production between studios in China and the US, so there was bound to be some elements in order to appeal to a western/US audience. I will say that the US trailer for the Great Wall, for someone who hasn't yet seen the movie, does set up the potential for a movie like this to become whitewash. I think for those who see the film for themselves, may not find that to be the case.",

People gobbled up the earlier Zhang Yimou's films like they were made of gold. China's domestic market that is, not the international market. \n\nIt's never about the box office. Ang Lee made Crouching Dragon and the Hulk so that he could make art films like BrokeBack and the Storm. And even for these \"art films,\" the box office did pretty decent. What doesn't make money are independent films (like those for Sundance), and this is true for the US and China.  \n\n\nWhy is no one watching Jia Zhangke?\n\nHe is a fucking independent filmmaker with no commercial and political backing. \n\nWhat is at the heart of the matter is 1) lack of funding and 2) censorship. Most Chinese movies are funded by the state (private enterprises in China are not exactly \"private\" in the strict sense of the word). Very little money is going to independent films.\n\nThen we have the censorship bureau -- that is one heck of a powerful organization. You want to critique the state? Sure, but your movie doesn't get a release in China. Go ahead, you can show it at the Venice Film Festival and make $200 in Europe and the US. But you know what, we will also forbid you from making another film for 10 years in China. \n\nChina's history of cinema is fascinating. Currently, we are getting even fewer independent films (and big budget \"art films\" are also becoming rarer), due to the changing political climate in recent years. ",

Though obviously China doesn't care about a white guy heading a China centric movie... does this get interpreted as making whitewashing pointless or stay the course?\n\nTime will tell. And how many movies follow Star Wars and how well they do. ",

            "body": "Do you even facts, bro? \n\nRaise the Red Lantern did NOT do very well in China - seeing as it was BANNED upon release (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raise_the_Red_Lantern#cite_note-2). And even if it did come out in theaters in 1992 (which it didn't), there was hardly any domestic theatrical market in China to speak of at the time. \n\nJust as an example of what the market was like in the 1990's:\n\nThe highest grossing movie of 1994 was none other than 'The Fugitive', starring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. It was the first imported Hollywood film to be officially shown in Chinese theaters since the 1940s' following Communist Liberation (or 'Takeover', if that's your bag), and it made a grand total of...\u00a525.8 million RMB. \n\nNot accounting for the low rate of yuan inflation and using the present day CNY to USD exchange rate, that comes out to a grand total of...$3.75 million USD, good for the highest-grossing theatrical release in China in 1994. \n\nNo \"gobbling\" of anything happened in Chinese theaters until really the past decade (with the success of 'Titanic' in 1998 being a precursor of the norm that's prevalent today). \n\nAnd granted Jia Zhangke has often run afoul of censors, but his last release ('Mountains May Depart' in 2015) was a high-profile arthouse film for China, and nobody saw it anyway (about \u00a520 million RMB gross, or $3 million USD with present exchange rate), at least if you're comparing with mainstream stuff that would consider a \u00a520 million gross to be a complete failure. \n\nHowever, you cannot say he doesn't get any money for new projects, since he is absolutely at the top tier of established art film directors in China, and could easily get money for his next project.\n\nYou're going to tell me he can't get funding when he's done 5 feature films and 3 documentaries since 2004 (when his movie 'The World' was the first release to get official approval)? You're going to tell me he can't get funding after 'A Touch of Sin' literally made NO MONEY IN CHINESE THEATERS since it was banned in 2013? He released 'Mountains May Depart' in 2015, after completing a movie that made no money in China in 2013. Sounds like he's really struggling to find investors, right? Right. \n\nRelatively not much money is going to independent films, but that doesn't mean they aren't still being made and shown in Chinese theaters. I'm sure you've seen 'Crosscurrent', 'Kaili Blues', and 'Tharlo', right? All three of those played in Chinese theaters in 2016. Or what about 'Knife in the Clear Water'? That just won Best Director at the Marrakech International Film Festival, with a jury that was headed by Bela Freaking Tarr. \n\nCensorship in China can be ugly, oppressive and creatively stifling, but that doesn't mean things aren't still being made. But like George Lucas said, monetary considerations for Hollywood blockbusters also leads to creative asphyxiation. It is what it is and people still take their films to Sundance or Berlin, and they hope for the best in negotiating with censors (if they didn't get approval already), as well as distributors (who can be just as tough to convince). \n\nIf your point is that nobody is making art or indie-type films in China anymore because there's no money for projects, then that's not really true. If your point is that those kinds of films aren't being allowed into local theaters, then that's also not really true either. Your point about Jia Zhangke not drawing an audience because he can't get money or political backing isn't true, since his last approved film got a shit-ton of marketing for an art film, and audiences simply just weren't interested.   \n\nChina's history of cinema is fascinating, but what's even more fascinating is its present, where there is an imperfect but thriving domestic market that can actually produce and consume its own content in a huge way (and that's not something that can be said for most film markets in the world). \n\n'Raise the Red Lantern' and 'Farewell, My Concubine' came out at a time when there was huge post-Tiananmen cultural interest in China from the global community, and when there was also NO CHANCE that the films could actually find a legit audience in 80s'/early 90s' China that could pay to go see films on thousands of modern theater screens that didn't suck. \n\nThere was literally no other brass ring for Chinese filmmakers of that era to aim for besides international film fest glory. And now that the market has expanded so that a film like 'Mermaid' can achieve the 7th all-time highest-gross from a single territory ($525 million USD earned in China in 2016), you can be sure as shaped-up shit that filmmakers are going to try to get rich quick. \n\nHOWEVER, it's a situation where all boats are being lifted, however imperfectly - with the expansion of the market as a whole and people just watching more movies than ever, it also means the market for arthouse films in China is growing at the same time that the commercial market is exploding. \n\nIt's still a lopsided ratio, but to complain so inaccurately about the present situation while praising the past - that just shows you're not keeping up with what's going on and have no idea about that which you speak of.\n\n\n\n\n",

Had they made the kind of \"good movie\" that wins prizes at Oscars and other festivals like Cannes and Oscars, much less people would have gone to see it, and maybe they wouldn't even recover the cost of production. And that is my explanation to Dong_Hung_lo and cagedcat as to \"Why does it feel like that Chinese movies are getting worse and worse every year?\"\n\nBetter or worse is subjective, but what is happening for sure is the directors want to movies that can sell in the domestic market (China). Complete fantasy movies like this where it's swimming and flying around in 100kg+ full plate armor or the ones set in the present day where it looks like all of the characters have unlimited money and don't need to work and just engage in cheesy dialogue and cliched relationships. That is what sells tickets in China. I just hope at some point this type of Chinese movies can move a bit more towards the direction of \"Lord of the rings\" where nerds can argue endlessly about the weight of Gandalf's staff or the flying speed of an eagle, so directors would have to pay a bit more attention to making scenes that look at least somewhat plausible with respect to the laws of physics.",

The growing educated, middle class is a big consumer. \n\n2) Recent censorship has decreased the number of good big budget art house films that are shown in the theaters \n(Such as \"Let the Bullet Fly\") in favor of big budget films that suck ass. \n\n3) Zhang Jiake makes good indie films, but he's not popular, just as other art house directors are not popular in the US. \n\n4) I know good indie films are made, but they don't have the level of commercial backing that big directors' arthouse projects get. I personally know indie film makers who find it much harder to find funding in China and had trouble with the censorship board since 2011. And plenty of films don't make past the censorship board. \n\nMinor mistake about Raise the Lantern.

Like say everyone just casually assumed they'd cast a white guy and never even broached alternatives, maybe assuming the studio wouldn't go for it. And being a statistical problem in nature there is also always a 'plausible' defense against every specific case. \n\nAnd by the same time pushing back against this sort of thing will be arbitrary by nature... because it is hard to get fired up every single time this rears its head. Why one might be denied the chance to see any big popcorn movies at all because it is just so omnipresent. \n\nFurthermore consider your other examples for false perception. Do you have some numbers quantifying and backing up the claim, have you controlled for maybe just forgetting people did complain? Even accepting the premise as true we have to consider other factors. Last Samurai was a long time ago now, we've in that time seen gay marriage go from hot button social fault line I've even seen conservative die hards say \"move on, we lost\" to. This isn't the only significant shift of the last decade+ I could id. Far less the case in 47 Ronin but then I might be willing to argue there are some not insignificant shifts in more recent years. Also Keanu hadn't done anything notable since his Klaatu remake being generous, the first Matrix being less generous. Hardly Matt Damon or Tom Cruise. \n\nCertainly this isn't the only movie I've heard complaints of this sort about stretching back to the Last Airbender in 2010. I might dispute any of them amount to significant complaint actually, as opposed to just mutterings on the internet. This is not yet quite a major issue.\n\nOh and finally the scope of complaint has no bearing on the merits of the charge. Reality and truth are not democracies, if 7 billion people say one thing and 1 person alone says another... well it's the same as if just two people had disagreed, one is right and the other wrong.

It managed to save face by crossing the 1 billion RMB threshold, but that is like getting a C when you needed an A++ on the biggest test ever. \n\nThe Great Wall was supposed to be the Chinese blockbuster to end all blockbusters since it had the all-time highest budget for any Chinese film, with a reported production budget of $150m USD (though it went overbudget and could be as high as $180m USD). \n\nIf we're talking in very loose terms, then the movie would have to make at least $450-$500m USD worldwide to simply not lose money. Its gross is going to squeak just barely past $300m USD worldwide (currently at approx $270m USD), and that means the Hollywood and Chinese investors are getting a serious haircut with TGW. \n\nFor comparison, 'Mermaid' cost \u00a5400m RMB ($58m USD), which is already a really high budget for a Chinese film, since most mainstream films will cost between one-quarter and one-eighth of that amount. It needed to gross around \u00a51.2 billion RMB to break even, but instead went all the way to \u00a53.4 billion RMB.\n\nGiven the ambitions that 'The Great Wall' had, I think anything less than \u00a52.5 billion RMB in China would have been a disappointment, and in the end it couldn't even muster half of that (it did \u00a51.17 billion RMB, even against crappy competition). \n\nAs for wanting to see something that compares with 'Lord of the Rings'...I think you gotta keep in mind that Hollywood is the only entity in the world that can produce films of that caliber. \n\nThe series might feature a director from New Zealand and cast and crew from Europe and beyond, but make no mistake, LOTR is pure Hollywood. Could it have been made without the backing of a major studio? I'm not sure that it could, and the same goes for 'Harry Potter'. Could the 'Potter' series have been done only with support from British production companies and no investment, development, marketing and distribution backing from Warner? Nope, I don't think so.\n\nNobody would expect the Bollywood or the French or Italian or Scandinavian film industries to try and mount a huge and epic fantasy series on their own, but the expectations for China is a different case altogether. Even Japan can't do live action films that the rest of the world wants to see! Did you try to watch 'Attack On Titan'? I mean...\n\n'The Great Wall' was the first sacrificial lamb, and hopefully it didn't ruin things for future attempts from Hollywood and China to create a co-production film that everybody wants to see. It might take 10 years or it might never happen. Like my man Clooney circa 2009, it's all pretty up in the air at this point.  \n",

I believe Falcon was the first black guy who wasn't Black [Whatever], and then there's the sort of shit that went on in the Golden Age. Replacing some of that is exactly what should be done. Comics themselves are not a model one should follow being a if not dead but still pretty stagnant medium.

Which I suppose might give it some study value but otherwise well you could pay me to watch it again... but you *would* have to pay me. \n\nOh and who said anything about banning?",

Casting white people in a movie is not evil though.\n\nI'm not trying to wound you by saying you are a racist, I'm not even accusing you of being a racist. But what you said in your post is racist. However, if your goal is to belittle and rally action against the white man, then yes, i'm afraid you are a racist. Criticising white people for the colour of their skin is racist, criticising men for their gender is sexist and criticising heterosexual people for their sexuality is heterophobic. It works both ways.\n\nI'm not sure how being content in seeing white actors in movies in a predominantly white western society is evil. As I've already mentioned too, we are very much seeing a change. People of all colours, religions, sexuality and members of both genders are getting many roles in film and TV. The three movies I watched over the weekend were very diversified. One featured many black actors and a homosexual male (Hidden Figures), the second featured a lesbian, many black characters and actors of different nationalities (John Wick 2) and the third featured a nearly complete Chinese cast (The Great Wall). That was just this weekends releases. You keep calling for action, but doing what? Just moaning about it and not realising that things ARE changing.\n\nGone with the Wind, adjusted for inflation is the most commercially successful film of all time, yes. You are correct. Firstly, that does not make it the most popular film of all time. Secondly, are you saying we should blame modern cinema goers that record numbers of people went to see a movie in 1939? The novel, which came out 3 years earlier, was a HUGE hit and back in 1939 you didn't have 4 blockbusters coming out a week. It was cheaper, there was less variety in choice of films to watch, the book was a huge success and the stars of the film were icons. Of course it was going to be successful. But what is your point? You don't like it.....okay, good for you. What are you getting at?\n\nAnd you never mentioned banning these movies, that's true. But I have no idea what you are getting at. You keep saying we need to act and doing nothing is 'evil'. What do you want from us? Do you want us to join you in droves and pointlessly (and racistly) complain about the colour of an actors skin?",
