I mean, the Ferris Bueller reference, Deadpool punching Colossus, Deadpool breaking the 4th wall, it was hysterical.\n\n* The action was bloody and stylized. Felt like a comic book torn off the pages and put to the screen. Precisely the action I expect from an R-rated superhero movie.\n\n* A lot of people didn't like the non-linear storytelling, but I was very fond of it. I honestly worried the first half of the movie is plainly setting up the origin story, then the second half transitions into a Deadpool kills people montage. But with this format, it is refreshing.\n\n* Speaking of refreshing, the R-rating was very refreshing. I really enjoyed the sex montage. This is one of the most romantic superhero films and Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin had the perfect on screen chemistry. Vanessa could also be a badass.\n\n* Colossus was great in action and offered some of the best humor.\n\n* I can't help but feel a lot of the side characters could've used more screen time: Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Colossus, but given the small scale of this movie, I understand why it is what it is.\n\n* Villains were rather weak.\n\nEDIT:\n\n* I love that a lot of this humor was characters saying things that are going through the audiences's minds as opposed to cheesy one liners. For example, Deadpool saying the studio couldn't hire another X-Men, and Wade saying 'that came out wrong' after telling the guy he has hard parts.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\n* I loved Junkie XL's score. It was perfectly in synch with the action and aligned impeccably with everything on screen. It was synthesized and had a lot of 80s influence and it sounded great. I'm excited for Junkie XL's work on *Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.* He's definitely going places. \n\nThis is by far the most entertaining superhero movie, and the most entertaining movie I've seen for a while. It isn't the most accomplished movie, it won't win awards, but it was funny, bloody, refreshing and I enjoyed every second of it. Worth the price.",

Some parts were really funny and clever, but there was a lot of stuff that was just unfunny and trying too hard. I sort of chalked most of the cringey humor to Deadpool, the character, being extremely immature, so I don't have as much of a problem with it as maybe some other people do. That being said, I think they could have dialed it back a little bit and maybe made the film a little darker here and there. They sort of danced around the darker tone a little bit, but I don't feel like they really committed to it as much as they could or should have. I also really enjoyed Ryan Reynolds and, whether you enjoy the movie or not, I think his love for the character really shines through. Deadpool didn't seem as one-dimensional as I feared he would be from the trailers. That being said, it felt like I had already seen most of this movie in the various trailers. And I don't say all of this as a riff on \"They always show everything in the trailers! Blah Blah Blah\" but rather that I didn't really feel like this movie surprised me in any way. At first, it was kind of interesting how the origin/flashback aspect of the story was structured throughout the whole movie, but after the first hour I think it actually hurt the film's pacing. \n\nThe movie was a little better than I expected it to be, but nowhere near as good as a lot of people are praising it as. I was entertained, and I enjoyed Ryan Reynolds' performance, but after watching it I kind of felt really underwhelmed and wished I'd just spent my money on something else. ",

The only small problem I have that a lot of Deadpool's jokes are about things we don't have or people we don't know in the Netherlands. At times I was the only one in the room that laughed at a joke, the rest didn't know the reference.\n\nThe Hugh Jackman jokes were hilarious, the empty X-Men mansion and Deadpool's explanation for it were perfect. There's a good soundtrack as well. I really could go on and on writing up moments I loved, but let's keep this post short. For a movie, I'll give it an 8/10. For a Deadpool movie it's a 10/10. Can't wait for the sequel!",

You had the jokes coming at you every which way, but when the jokes stopped, it really had a nice romance plot with enough drama to give the whole thing some weight. That sex montage, though... Loved it. \"Happy Woman's Day.\"\n\nReally loved Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, too. They really made the film feel like it belongs to a larger world. Just moments like Colossus watching the news while eating cereal, and recognizing the chaos that was being reported on was all Deadpool made me grin.\n\nThe 4th wall breaking didn't feel as forced as I feared it might be. The \"McAvoy or Stewart?\" line might be my favourite line of the whole movie.\n\nMy whole theater was laughing all the way through. I was the only one who laughed at the appearance of Bob, though... It was cool to see Bob.\n\nThis is the Deadpool movie I wanted. So happy with it.",

The TV show on the watch, the references to the Sony/Marvel feud, and the obvious insults toward Origins's Deadpool and Reynolds's Green Lantern are going to be obscure in a few years, but they work really well now.\n\nPeople can say it'll age poorly. That makes sense. A good number of the jokes are meant for the people watching it right now (see above). But some of the jokes are just overall funny. \"I feel sorry for your wife\" has no particular reference and is going to be funny a few years from now too, as is the trailer quote \"I feel sorry for the guy who pressures her into prom sex\".\n\nI have no complaints about this movie. Reynolds was perfect as Deadpool. You could see how much he enjoyed playing the character on screen. One of the previous comments mentioned \"labor of love\" and I couldn't agree more. Besides the obvious personal investment in the movie, there were no extraneous side plots, I never felt like a scene was included to add length, and I genuinely enjoyed each character on screen. Everything that makes me annoyed at movies that would otherwise be amazing was excluded.\n\nA lot of movies try to add to the genre as an art form. Deadpool tries to entertain, and it succeeds at this point wonderfully. Please go see it in theaters, we need more movies that make their first goal entertainment.",

Great action and funny jokes. After that the movie sort of becomes this weird romantic comedy with a bad and overly simplistic plot, as well as a bunch of non interesting characters(excluding Deadpool of course). To me it felt like the writers were relying too much on \"Oh this isn't your average superhero movie, cause BAM!! We got some blood, and a ton of dirty jokes along with swearing!\" that they didn't bother to develop any of the characters, or make the plot more dynamic than *Protagonist' girlfriend gets kidnapped by the people he's trying to kill so he has to save her*. Had they been consistent with the action sequences maybe i'd be able to look over the whole middle portion of the film(which was just a myriad of hit or miss jokes), but considering that the only other good fight scene was at the very end of the movie(and was nothing compared to the opener) it's hard to give Deadpool the praise that everyone seems it deserves. Would love to here other peoples thoughts on the film.\ufeff",

On that front I thought it was fantastic. \n\nOn the grand scheme of things though I can't help but feel that it was a little underwhelming. Just a tad. Maybe because it was an origin story? The villain is weak and there isn't much to the plot. Revenge story where the guy gets the girl at the end. Whoopee. \n\nDespite those negative things I don't see myself rating it any lower than a 7/10 and would much rather rewatch this over half of the MCU. My theater was roaring with laughter at points which certainly helped the experience.

But it didn't. The comedic beats were good and Deadpool never quite crossed that line of being *too* annoying. Almost all of his lines hit, and there were some great visual gags and the like to help break it up.\n\nI also like the way it was structured, which really helped with the pacing a whole lot, tying into what I said earlier about it never crossing the line and becoming too grating.\n\nI could talk more about it but basically, it was a super fun movie.

Avengers are just too kids friendly that I'm kinda numb.\n\nOverall, I'm glad that there's a new genre in comic book films.",

But what happens when you take the R-rating (and Ryan Reynolds' performance) out of the picture?\n\nThen you're left with a piss poor derivative origin story that is basically the same as *X-Men Origins: Wolverine*, an even more derivative central revenge story, a criminally underutilized set of supporting characters (Three movies with nothing to do? Just kill and save yourself from future misery, Colossus), an attractive actress that is the damsel-in-distress archetype/one-dimensional love interest, and of course, a fucking generic sociopathic villain.\n\nThere was a lot of potential with a Deadpool film, with a self-aware comic book character gifted with the ability to break the fourth wall and jab the audience in their ribs with a slab of the wall. How it tries to be satirical and commentate on the saturation of the market with superhero films is commendable... before you realize the commentary is almost pedestrian in quality, and doesn't bother to go deeper or be the change it desperately wants to be with all the disapproving finger waving.\n\nAs a fan of the character and one that is utterly disappointed with this by-the-numbers film, *Deadpool* is nothing more than an 8-year-old stale double cheeseburger wrapped in an new edgy, vulgar packaging. Truly the R-rated, spandex-wearing Jesus that will save the market from PG-13 formulaic oversaturation.",

The biggest problem i have with the movie is that i just find the character of Deadpool and his humour a bit exhausting. There were certainly funny jokes, but the quips per minute ratio was far far too high for my liking. And i really can't stand his meta-ness. Pointing out your flaws doesn't mean they are 1 and void. Case in point, saying the movie stars a \"British villain\" and \"a hot chick\" doesn't mean its not valid to criticise the fact that his girlfriend was a walking talking cliche and the villain was a moustache-twirling British villain who can't feel pain with shit, capitalist motivations. \n\nA lot of people will love this movie, and that's fine.

Small stakes for one since it's just a revenge story made it absolutely refreshing in an era of \"save the world\" heroics. I don't exactly feel Reynolds is as perfect for the role as everyone still thinks, but he had a bouncy energy to the film and he definitely had phenomenal screwball vulgar chemistry with Morena Baccarin. The flashback structure sort of made the bridge fight scene feel pretty inert every time we returned to it (and there never really seemed a rhythm behind its choices to go from Wade's origins to the bridge fight), but I really admire the decision behind it to bring us in media res. \n\nWhat I'm really most pleasantly surprised by, though, is its restraint. Making everything around the characters feel so tired and industrial to really have Deadpool's humor off-set just how visually broken everything around him is. And by just how deftly the writers and director did with what they had, such as the small budget only allowing for two primary setpieces (three kind of with Deadpool's escape), having Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead really feel a part of Deadpool's anti-arc of \"not\" becoming a hero (though I kind of feel it messes with the continuity to imply that Colossus and Deadpool already know each other in the implied-to-be short span of time between his mutation and the bridge fight), and most of all, making 100 minutes never lag nor feel rushed.\n\nI give it a 7/10.",

            "body": "I think the numerous amounts of trailers, teasers, and small clips that made their way around the internet and TV kind of ruined a lot of the potential jokes that they had in the film. TJ Miller said something about them being able to improv a lot of the jokes and I wish they would have used some of those that were cut out in the trailers so they didn't spoil the ones in the film. That being said, the movie was still pretty top notch. The humour was much more interesting since there was no holding back thanks to the R rating. Action was well choreographed and much more interesting and involving than a lot of other Marvel films. The easter eggs were also very tasteful and even though a couple of them were very \"in your face, look at me, look at me\" they still kind of worked without me hating them.\n\nHowever, that being said, it didn't feel like it was any different to any other Marvel film, despite being outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was very formulaic and the storyline is similar to any other origin movie we've seen over the past couple of years or so. On top of this, the final showdown at the end let the movie down in my opinion. It felt a little rushed - another redditor mentioned how ridiculous it was for Ajax to just have the same number of henchmen attack Deadpool and I agree. Maybe I was expecting too much of the movie, but for a hero that is typically known to break the mold, I was really hoping it would do so.",

I'm not saying this was a bad movie, I'm just going to nitpick:\n\n* the climax is the dumbest plan of any villain I can recall off the top of my head in movies. Like it was dumber than monologue-ing your whole scheme to the captured hero, or dumber than expecting a captured hero to die unseen in a needlessly complicated death trap. So he knows Deadpool is nearly unkillable by conventional means, sets a trap and has all the advantages of choosing the time and location of the battle. He even acknowledges that to kill Deadpool \"there has to be nothing left to heal\". SO what does he do? He goes all out and... hires a handful of faceless goons to line up like some kind of 19th century firing squad and shoot at a guy that heal near-instantly? No bombs? No flamethrowers? Nothing that could impair his movement even? You couldn't even get an acme cage to fall on him? They just lined up and shot at him. I mean, the action sequences were great but that was one lazy ass set up. \n\n* I loved Colossus in this movie, he had great presence, and he finally got to be a bit of badass... but his role was ultimately simplistic and it's always a bit of a bummer when they use tough characters like him just to show how tough a bad guy is like they did when she throws her first punch and sends him flying (again, not a huge deal, just a little nit-pick)\nAlso, his role was one of those points in the plot that didn't in any way take away from my enjoyment of the movie, but didn't actually make logical sense. Logically speaking, Deadpool was a mercenary with a spotty record going on a straight up murderous rampage. He wasn't just killing people in the midst of a life or death firefight (especially since he can't really be hurt), he was actually murdering people with god knows how many innocents getting caught in the crossfire, and straight up executed an unarmed person at the end. In spite of all this, the big boy scout wants him to be X-Man? No, he's a straight up psychotic villain on a rampage that needs to be stopped (logically speaking).\n\n* Breaking the 4th wall is not in and of itself clever or funny, rather it's a device that *can* be used to be clever or funny. This movie didn't make that distinction and some of felt very forced (like him acknowledging that he was breaking the fourth wall - that's not clever; it's not a substitute for an actual joke). \n\n* On the subject of humour, while most of the jokes were great a few were downright awful. As I commented elsewhere,  the \"Let's dance!\" \"No, Let's fight!\" line is probably going to be the cringiest line of any movie I see this year, and it happened right at the climax too.\n\nAnyways, I really enjoyed the movie, and I could do a longer list of the things I liked, but I just felt like opening a discussion about some of things that *didn't* work since everyone else only had nice things to say. \n\nedit: also if you'll forgive me for being **super** nitpicky: I'm not sure how I feel about Colossus's ludicrously cartoonish proportions. And how much money did they spend rendering him in CGI for every scene? Why not hire an actor to play him and just armor up for the fights? With the money saved they might have been able to use a *third* X-Man! (ok, not really but I'm still curious)\n\nedit 2: I love how many people are arguing that I and others must not \"get\" the character because it's normal for the character to break the fourth wall, or that we must be unfamiliar with the comics. First off, even if none of has have read comics, you shouldn't have to read the comics to enjoy the movie. But that's not really relevant because it's not that complicated. He breaks the fourth wall. That's great. But here's the rub: it can be a characters thing to tell jokes all the time, but if the jokes aren't funny then the fact that it's \"his thing\" doesn't make them funny. Similarly, just because it's a common gag for Deadpool to break talk to the audience doesn't mean that every application of it is automatically funny. You're not special because you \"get\" the character and I don't, your just missing my point. You can even just say that you disagree with me because you found something funny that I didn't: that's fine, humour is of course subjective. But it's not like the gag is going over my head... It's just not always funny.",

Yes he doesn't feel pain but still a sword through your torso shouldn't be something you just shake off. What was the point of the bathroom scene in the strip club? It just doesn't make sense that he would hesitate in a situation like this. That scene in the end where Ajax is on the floor with bloody teeth. And then his teeth are white and shiny.

Unfortunately, I don't think we'd ever see Deadpool appear in any Marvel films (X-men vs Avengers anyone?) because for Deadpool to be at his peak the movie would have to be rated R, and Marvel wouldn't make an Avengers film rated R. \n\nIt'd be nice to see Fox let Marvel make an actual good Fantastic Four film, or borrow an X-men member or two like what Sony is doing with Spiderman. \n\nThe ultimate dream is to see a rated R X-men vs Avengers film, but I doubt Marvel would let their carefully crafted family friendly Avengers characters to be used in a film that would treat their powers as realistic (like Hulk crushing a person into mush or Iron Man vaporizing a person). Also personally I think it'd be a little jarring to see these pg-13 characters we know go to being rated R versions of themselves. They could try to make it so the Avengers characters stay pg-13 and Deadpool's character rated R, but it would also be jarring to watch Deadpool cut a person in half then watch Iron Man blast a guy with his hand, only for the guy to be pushed into a wall.",

The movie only falls short once you step back and evaluate the storyline as a whole. In actuality, it's incredibly generic and inconsequential. The plot is shallow. Generic bad guy does bad guy things, steals the girl, then girl gets saved and bad guy loses. We never get any background as to the villain's organization, their activities, or their motivation. They are flat characters that only exist to further the plot so we can watch Deadpool do more things. You can almost ignore that problem, though, since it's really fun to watch Deadpool do things. Let's be honest, we didn't come to this movie to watch some brilliant villain's character development. They could have almost made this movie nothing but an hour and a half of endless fight scenes full of similar witty banter and it would be enjoyable. It's incredible how many jokes get fired at you one after another, and how many aren't just funny but hilarious. The jokes do get a little exhausting by the end, and you can sense just a tiny bit of laziness or perhaps complete joke depletion on behalf of the writers as the movie goes along. I look forward to another movie where they hopefully explore deeper plot development to compliment the fantastic job of portraying this unique character's idiosyncrasies.\n\n8/10.\n",

How does he get away? If he just pushes it through his body, wouldn't some evidence of that shown once he came up through the ashes of the building? \n\nAlso, did they reference the glass tube being indestructible/made out of super strong glass/material? The one that Vanessa was in during the final fight/fall? Why else would it, and her, have been unharmed? \n\nIs this movie at all tying in with the Marvel Cinematic Universe?

It felt like some scenes dragged on forever because we'd seen so much of it - same could be said with some of the jokes; I definitely noticed that, in a full theater, only a few people chuckled at the jokes that had been shown repeatedly in trailers. And that was a considerable amount of the film. Still, coming in just wanting to laugh, I had a good time - when the jokes were funny, they were funny. \n\nedit: also want to add: I want to know what happens next in the taxi driver's story. I know this initial impression seemed like I had more cons than pros, but it IS a fun film - the pacing was noticeable though. I'll probably see it again to catch more jokes that I missed.

Everyone but Deadpool is boring. \n\nColoussus is just CGI plus an entertaining voice, but he feels underused in the fights. Deadpool fights Ajax and Angel Dust? Well, for all intents and purposes, they are normal looking people. Ajax is strong and can\u2019t feel pain? Okay. Angel Dust is super Colossus strong? Okay. I still feel the entire film he is just fighting easy to kill gangsters and these two normal looking people. The villains don\u2019t pop out and never in any way feel hardcore.\n\n\nAnd second, the intro I didn\u2019t like. The car chase/accident was nice. But after he did the killing, it kept getting broken up by the backstory. The backstory felt incredibly long. The torture scenes were long. It just had me nodding my head, yeah yeah, get back to being Deadpool!\n\n\nJust overall it didn\u2019t feel like the movie had enough happening in it.

I only came here to see if there was anyone else wondering with me. Me and my girlfriend were both excited to see this and deadpool wasn't new to either of us, but this didn't feel like a smartass, sarcastic dark-humor deadpool, this felt like \"what's the most fucked up potty humor we can make here\" and then they shoved the \"naughty super hero\" premise down your throat the entire film. CONSTANT commentary after every. Single. Action, like he shoots at a bad guy and misses: \"bad deadpool\" then he hits a bad guy \"GOOD deadpool\" the only people I know who make jokes like that are 11. Nobody in my (small 30 person) theater laughed either so I didn't think it was just me after a while. The really funny lines in the movie Were not the \"cue-the-joke\" lines or the \"This cock-gobbling ball-chewer\" lines, they were things like the X-men house blowing up every 2 years or which Professor Xavier, my favorite was \"I would go with you, but I don't want to\" everything else in the movie was mostly desperate humor. To me The concept of a super-hero that doesn't give a shit wasn't polished and matured, it was like a first take at the script and then they tried to force the premise of a \"naughty\" super hero down your throat. Even just the way his voice went up and down when he did the narration gave me a clowny awkward second-hand-embarrassment feel to it. I was mega let down. In fact I got more deadpool from Guardians of the galaxy where the humor wasn't REALLY trying to be whacky, zany, dick-punching stuff but there were still comments like Chris Prats ship looking like a Jackson Paloc painting under a black light and a hero who was a hero by accident. \n\nGlad it's doing well, hopefully studios will be more willing to take risks on movies or work on a medium budget.

The only aspects of the film that are NOT normative superhero fodder are Deadpool's wisecracking lines and the sexual content, neither of which really make this film the satire or parody it could have been. \"Guardians\" did a better job with satire than this.\n\nI understand why this film feels like a breath of fresh air now, but I don't think it will hold up very well at all over the next few years. The action sequences are extremely dull, many of the references are of only topical/momentary relevance, and too much time was wasted on melodramatic romance.",

The film goes from being very visual with the gags one time and covering them up or panning the camera away at other times. Other than that, it seems the movie has won over the audience by going where jokes and visuals usually never go for in a comic book film for a major mainstream comic continuity. In both sexual and violence imagery, it went to places where even many comedic and drama shows don't  go. And I  love how it was all shot and framed, that made it all work. And the audience really was surprised by it.\n\nA bit of a shame that the main villains likely won't  be back again (except for one), but I  hope Deadpool and Cable can really go after some big ids in comics now. Obviously, the organization in this film are in the business of making mutants, so I  hope there is an even bigger crossover with other mutants and maybe Deadpool can even cameo in a future Xmen film or they can even have a more comprehensive crossover someday.\n\nI wonder if the broader Marvel studio might be willing to let him make an appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well. The future is really bright for Deadpool as a character. This is something I  swore would never happen after how Deadpool was treated in that Wolverine movie. But now, it seems like anything could happen for Deadpool. I am very happy for the director Tim Miller and Ryan Reynolds too. I hope both of their futures are secured thanks to this film.",

Had a decent lively audience who made the experience better (although one guy kinda overdid it).  \n\nMajor gripes with the movie is that I didn't understand the main baddies powers - I understand he can't feel pain (I'll accept that its not a debilitating power) but I don't understand how he fought so well and was so powerful.  \n\nAlso, I usually like origin stories, but Deadpool's went on too long (movie wasn't badly paced, just that too much time was spent on Deadpool origins) and I wished the movie would have focused on the growing craziness of his character and how he developed his fighting abilities.  The movie does explain that he's a mercenary with like 41 confirmed kills, but when we see him in deadpool mode he's doing ninja stuff so I don't understand how he knows that, especially since he didn't get his mutant powers until the doctor subjected him to the experiments.  Also, Deadpool was a bit goofy before his transformation, but I would have liked more dialogue about him just loosing it.  \n\nGripes aren't that big though.  I really enjoyed the movie, and will definitely be picking it up when it comes out. ",

Basically this whole movie is a secret fuck you to the license issue altogether... This is the reason why he references McAvoy and Patrick like he does and there's also memorabilia with toys from the failed wolverine movie as well and other crack to the FOX versions of the X-Men. You see in this Universe these movies were actually just that, MOVIES and they were somehow maybe based upon the real MCU version of the X-Men, which is why we don't get to see any of the other X-men yet as well and even though jokingly he says they couldn't afford more X men in the film he, still could have been referencing any number of the X-men films as well, as they cut their roster and cheezed up some of the characters significantly, due to budgetary reasons. \nSo this being said that is also why we see a fucked up helicarrier being disassembled, maybe due to the events of what happened in Capt. Merica's winter soldier. Also the syndicate responsible for giving him his powers seem awfully Hyra-esqe, if you ask me. There's a little more I could throw at this theory but I'm sure you get the point. \nSo basically DEADPOOL is actually an unofficial MARVEL Movie and they are secretly setting it up to where they can bring these two franchises back together. Whattya y'all think?",

I enjoyed that Deadpool acknowledged he is not really a hero and never changed from that.\n\nI did not laugh once during the movie. The humor reminds me of the humor I used in my aim chats back in middle school. Barely any of the jokes landed with me because I just felt they were so predictable. It wasn't like I was rolling my eyes and hated it, I found it humorous but not enough to laugh out loud. As someone posted a few days ago... the humor is very \"LoL so random!!!1 XD\" The humor for me is also something that once I've seen or heard the joke once, I don't really need to see again. The thing I hate about most superhero movies are the one liners... this movie was ALL one liners.\n\nI did like the very simplistic story, which I guess others didnt. I also liked that it was more light hearted than most others. It was more fun and (obviously) didn't take itself seriously.\n\nOverall it's definitely good, but for me the humor is a little meh. I'd watch it again for free if someone was like \"Hey wanna watch this while you clip your toenails\"",

I know there's only 2-3 action sequences, and revealing a majority of the parts from it really took away from it in the cinema. \n\nI usually hate crass humor that's forced, but honestly, it all felt natural in this setting. Deadpool IS that snarky, explicit, douche-hero and I felt all the humor worked. The meta humor, sex jokes, even the violence was comedic. A lot of Deadpool's banter during the fights cracked me up too. I'm gonna give it an 8/10. I think movies like The Raid/2 has changed my thirst for violence in films. I wanted to see Deadpool fuck more people up brutally. There obviously were some great kills. Guess the movie accomplished my purchased ticket for the sequel. Ryan Reynolds was born for this role. \n\nAnd might I add the fact that he's still doing the character after the movie released is perfect. His spoof of Kanye's SNL meltdown was hysterical. I hope he becomes an embedded pop culture icon.",

The meta stuff is fantastic too.\n\nReynolds and T.J. Miller are superb. Also whoever voiced Colossus killed it.\n\nAction sequences are very well directed.\n\nPost-credits scene is awesome\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nToo many flashbacks\n\nIt's surprisingly formulaic.

Eventually the audience was really into all of it. \n\nAs a huge Deadpool fan, I think this movie was everything it needed to be. It was Deadpool brought to life, no compromises, worts and all. Deadpool is a polarizing character. If you like Deadpool, you'll love this movie.\n\nThere were times when I could feel the movie's tight budget, but even that issue was handled masterfully. What's great about the Deadpool character is that any faults this movie may have can be explained away or excused  because it is a Deadpool Movie. If a particular joke doesn't land, you can say, \"well sometimes Deadpool makes shitty jokes\". If it was expertly polished and prestine and if it took itself too seriously or tried to meet really high cinematic expectations, it wouldn't be Deadpool. The imperfections actually help make the movie feel more authentic. id another character that could get away with that? I bet Sony wished they could have had that kind of freedom from expectations with Spiderman. \n\nI'm confident this movie has earned Deadpool many sequels and cameos for the Merc in the X-Men Universe and I can't wait. As a character, Deadpool works best when he plays off of other big characters. That'll be fun to watch. \n\nAlso, I know Fox has been wondering who could take the torch from Hugh Jackman and be the hot selling point for X-Men after he leaves the character. I think they are going to now have to look at Ryan Renolds and Deadpool. I know it sounds crazy, but Deadpool is going to be a monster success for them, especially considering its Rated R. And if you understand Deadpool's tenious relationship with the X-Men in the comics, you can appreciate how ironic and hilarious the prospect of that can be.",

Supporting roles actually had something to bring to the table, and made you care about them. The romance part was nicely done, honestly despite how twisted and crazy it was, it was touching nonetheless. I'm spreading the gospel and I'm signing up for sequels.

Sort of like how movies like Thor put a lot of effort into building the marvel universe while putting no effort into plot structure, character depth, and other stuff, Deadpool put a ton of effort into the writing and comedy aspect, which led to a few flaws.\n\nI think the plot was pretty bland. I never really like origin stories unless they're really original, but this just felt like a less overdramatic version of Wolverine's origin. I understand the point of the movie was to present Deadpool's origin story, but they could've definitely cut 30 minutes off it. The villain was pretty bland as well, we don't know anything about who he is, and his entire personality revolves around him being a huge a-hole. \n\nOn the flipside, the writing and Ryan Reynolds's acting were fantastic. The humor was on point for almost all the movie, high points for me were deadpool trying to fight colossus, and his line about telling beast to stop shitting on his lawn. Deadpool's interaction with the X-men was by far the best part of the movie, everything felt really organic and they all had some great lines between each other. I think if they focused more on Deadpool's \"being a dick to super heroes\" aspect and less on his origin story, it would've been a great movie",

I'd also love to see the version of Deadpool where his healing power becomes increasingly powerful but at the cost of his sanity.  Since Deadpool is quite literally insane for a lot of the comics. Unfortunately none of this is possible right now because Deadpool is simply too happy. His life is actually pretty nice. Chances are fox will keep Deadpool around add comic relief but there is a lot of potential for a truly deep character.",

I think that it's a good movie, it certainly could have been way worse based off of some prior examples- but, it was cool.\n\nI don't want to be that guy.\nBut I will.\nWent by really quickly- I think the flashbacks played a big part in that. The \"origin\", while I'm glad they kept it in, was innaccurate- his healing power comes from a jacked up version taken from wolverine, plus the \"deadpool\" game was player inside the treatment facility, not the bar. Loved that they kept the merc bar and Al, those were pretty nice. \n\nI think that the biggest things that threw me off were the amount if violence, the girl, and Deadpool's overall attitude. \n\nAny of his comics has him wading through at least 5 or six separate encounters with baddies, in addition to any plot points- the movie had three fights. \n\nIn most of the comics, Deadpool is a dude who's either chasing tail, caught tail, or is sobbing from his deep inadequacies- there are some storyline where he thinks he finds love, but it usually ends horribly. I think the classic guy saves girl thing didn't really work, because that's not what happens in the comics, unless she brutally dies in the next movie.\n\nHis humor is a shield, something he uses to compensate for the immense feeling of pain that he WADES through daily. Some statements about avacodo coitus and a \"ohhh I'm ugly\" scene don't do it justice. People die all around him. He has lived through much more horrible and traumatic experiences. Insecurity, inadequacy, and overall tragedy and failure are a HUGE factor in his character. He is borderline immortal, and thus separate from almost all of humanity. It's a heavy topic, and while touched on, I don't think the movie did it justice.\n\nLastly, his healing factor. In the cable and deadpool comics, cable will outright shoot deadpool in the head to get him to shut up, and he'll be talking two panels later. I don't know the precise time that sort of thing takes, but he wins a fight with wolverine due to his healing factor being faster- and, though I haven't seen them in a while, I think the x-man movies had a much faster heal time than this one. \n\nSo I mean.. yeah. Rewatchability is a big thing too, and I'm not so sure the same references will be funny the 8th time. \n\nAnyways, ecstatic an actual deadpool movie got made, it was better than most, but I probably wouldn't buy it.",

Kind of relieved that I didn't have to see the censored version in China, meanwhile considering the quality of the film it could do a great job on the box office (both Ant-man and Kingsman proved that you don't have to be a big/ family-friendly blockbuster to make big money in China), which will benefit the film a lot and the studio might be able to afford three X-men in the sequel. \n\nWatched it in 4DX the first time, the constant kicking in my back was a bit distracting but made me appreciate the action scenes better. Also I love how the songs were used, reminded me a bit of Guardians of the Galaxy. Was surprised to find out the soundtrack was composed by Junkie XL. Would definitely buy the bluray and ost.\n\nOne thing that went over my head is how could Deadpool expect someone as evil as Ajax would agree to cure him? \n\nPersonally I think it's by far the most unique film in MCU (how the story was told and how it's actually IS a love story) . If the tickets aren't so expensive in HK I'd be happy to watch it three or four times in a week. ",

            "body": "I've been an X-Men fan since the dark days of last century, and I was doing my best not to get excited about this movie - DeadPool in his own movie?  Fuck YEAH! No, no, no, don't get your hopes up.\n\nI've never like Ryan Reynolds.  He doesn't really have much depth as an actor, he's always just grated with me.  Despite this, he was a great choice as Deadpool, as Deadpool is kinda annoying as a character.\n\nWe're thrust straight into Deadpool's world, as the opening credits are all from his point of view.  The way the story (and opening action scene) is introduced and plays out is a really nice piece of cinematic story telling. \n\nI knew there would be a lot of breaking the fourth wall and Deadpool being dangerously genre aware, so I didn't find the jokes done in that vein as jolting as they could have been if I weren't expecting it.  I do think that they don't really take you out of the action regardless of whether you are expecting them or not.  \n\nWhen they work, the work really well (stick around for the end credits scene, the question of which 'Professor X' they were going to see), when the don't, they're very cheesy (OOOH! Green Lantern was a terrible film, and guess who played the hero?).  I would have liked to have seen less of the genera savvy jokes, and more of the Deadpool mouthy humour jokes.  Oh, and Ryan Reynolds.  Don't try to do an Australian accent again, ok?\n\nAlong with the jokes come the action.  My goodness golly gosh the CG looks like arse.  It was woefully bad.  Bad enough to take you out of the story, which was annoying as they were well choreographed and directed.\n\nThe fight scenes are great, however.  Angel and Colossus' final battle is one of the best fight scenes I've seen in an US action film ever.  Having a former MMA fighter show her moves was pants-wettingly good.  Having the female villain being the 'big bad' was also a great piece of writing.\n\nFox  pulled some shenanigans on the budget (as referenced by Deadpool in the film), which - I think - meant the action scenes were less 'splody shooty and more hitty swordy.  This, in my opinion, made for better action.\n\nThis film has a near-naked Morena Baccarin, which would be worth the price of admission alone.  The love scenes between Vanessa and Wade are damn sexy.  I'm pretty sure the naked bum shot of Reynolds was just put in as a 'look, we aren't sexist'  by Fox.\n\nDeadpool's origin is fairly elastic in the comics, and having this particular setting works well for the film.  It also allows a simple introduction of the main villains of Ajax and Angel Dust.\n\nUsing the fairly obscure X-Men characters of both Angel Dust and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (don't worry, I had to google them as well) was a choice I'm a little confused with.  It's nice to be able to say 'here are these characters introduced in the Deadpool narrative', and sets it apart from Fox's other X-Men films, and all but the most strident fans wouldn't know that Negasonic's powers are nothing like in the comics, but having more 'well known' characters would have brought some more bankability to the film.\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable film.  I'm actually looking forward to the next one, and I hope that Cable is in it.\n",

It feels *fresh* and unhinged, and where some movies need restraint to be good, this movie understands its own chaotic balance. It's easy, but also unconventional. Inspired, but not overly weird. Hilarious, but not tiring or annoying and the humor never takes away from the action. It even has its serious moments, and I'm not afraid to admit that my tears were jerked a little at the end. Everything works astonishingly well. \n\nYou know that feeling you get when you watch a comic book movie that just doesn't work, like Xmen Origins: Wolverine?

I never read superhero comics growing up.  I didn't grow up caring about batman or superman or any of that.  And I haven't seen very many of the superhero movies that have been coming out for the past 10 years or whatever.  I've seen the Christopher Nolan batmans, the Spidermans with Tobey Maguire, like 1 Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and I think that's it.  I liked the batmans and the spidermans (first 2), mostly because I think those were actually good movies on their own, not just superhero movies.  The others were meh, didn't feel like they were that great of movies, so they couldn't win me over to care about the characters.  They didn't have much for me as someone who didn't come into the movie as a fan of the characters, is what I'm saying.\n\nSo, here I am, someone who doesn't really know deadpool.  Can I still enjoy this movie?  I like meta, witty, silly, humor--any kind of humor, really.  So I would imagine the type of humor in the movie would work for me.  But are they all \"inside\" jokes?--as in, do I need to know deadpool or the other superhero movies in order to understand and appreciate the jokes?  Can I enjoy the movie like I did the spiderman and batman movies?--or do I need to be fluent in deadpool comics in order to have fun with this?\n\nI ask because my brother is a big fan of deadpool and wants me to see this.  And to be honest, despite the fact that I generally don't like superheros, this deadpool character seems like fun to me.  I've seen a bit of him when my brother plays marvel vs capcom 3 and he seems fun.  I want to be able to go and enjoy this movie.  Do you guys think it will be possible for me to do this?",

Try writing clever wordplay, or characters so realistic everyone will recognize them from their own life, or situations where every new complication makes the audience gasp at its inevitable repercussions.

The action scenes also weren't funny, it kinda reminded me of that Jackie Chan every frame a painting episode. They were OK.

I didn't mind the gameplay myself, but I'm not a hardcore gamer, so I'm probably not as sensitize to such things.  I thought the game was so funny and entertaining that I watched a complete Let's Play of the whole game, and then I got the game and played it all the way through myself.  Absolutely hilarious.\n\nAnd here's a tip for you if you do end up playing it.  Any time there's an \"idle animation\" (Deadpool doing something when you're not pressing any keys), LET IT ROLL.  Don't interrupt it or move on with the game until it starts repeating.  Some of them run for about five minutes of new material, and it's all funny.  Also, when it gives you the option to press a button repeatedly or just go on with the game, keep pressing the button.  The one where he's slapping Wolverine was particularly hilarious.  \n\nIt's little touches like that which make me consider this the funniest game of this era.  I'd even call it funnier than South Park: The Stick of Truth.",

The reality is that DoFP was a polite (but far from perfect) way to pretend that X3 and Wolverine never happened, so they don't have to deal with the bed-shitting and could fix the franchise. \n\nBy all accounts if it were trying to be \"canonical\" then Deadpool would be a period film set in the 80's, which is more of a headache than it's worth. No one should blame them at all for just doing their own thing and vaguely pretending it all somehow fits into the post-DoFP timeline.",

I get what you are saying that some jokes you just wouldn't understand if you weren't up to date with current popular jokes/news but I still feel there was enough for everybody, so I'm surprised that there was silence, people were literally clapping when this movie ended, I didn't know people did that other than in made up thathappened stories",

He casually lobs a ball into the 50,000 points hole or whatever it was, which indicates pretty exceptional hand-eye coordination.

You learn to hate Ajax, as he is a douche that causes quite a lot of personal pain to Deadpool. Angel Dust is a glorified henchwoman, but her battle with Colosus was pretty entertaining, and actually serves to give Colossus some character development (breasts) which made him more endearing.\n\nColossus gets a pass for finally getting the character right. Finally he is in his metal state and actually doing something, showing his pacifistic character traits and honorable personality. He made the movie so much more 'real', which is ironic since be was mostly CG. I loved him and I'm fine if the pretty-boy X-men version never comes back. This was Colossus!\n\nThe story, while bipolar and a little sluggish, was important to establish the character. The flashbacks were my least favorite parts but if a little slow character development is my biggest complain on this movie, then it still stands miles above most of the Xmen franchise. This is a franchise that has the worst track record at telling an effective story. Wolverine Origins? Xmen 3? Hell, even Xmen 1, despite its importance, had terrible characters. Deadpool is a strong movie, with the most well-rounded cast to feature in a smaller super hero movie to date, IMO.\n\nTo each their own, though. ",

It was the perfect balance of being what drove the movie (alongside the revenge story), without taking up much screen time - and when it did take up screen time it was either heartwarming or hilarious. \n\nI thought the villain story was a little weak, but it was actually fairly logical and I don't think there were many different ways it could play out. Not much depth to the movie in that aspect, but it's a comedy primarily, so what can you expect?\n\nI loved the movie.

Vanessa was actually pretty badass, pulling a sword out with her bare hands and stabbing it through Ajax. If he wasn't a mutant he would've died and she would've saved herself. \n\nAlso, I didn't mind Ajax being one-dimensional because this was the origin story. We know Deadpool 2 is going to have Cable, and I think it's going to also include whoever was pulling Ajax's strings. Francis was not the leader, just the torturer.  \n\nAdditionally, I think they're going to kill off Vanessa in Deadpool 2 and make him a little more depressed and a little crazier. I think it would be interesting to have his relationship with Death potentially just be all in his mind (and Death could even be Vanessa with some CGI changes). ",

The comics seem to have a more decisive split because runs are rooted in a single writer's comedic sensibilities.",

But not everyone is going to love the film. Same as people who compare the book to the movies. I just so happen to be one of those people. I loved the scenes that weren't shown on the trailers. I just wish they changed it up a bit. The pre-alpha footage that was shown was 3892937392x better than the actual footage that was shown. THAT was the Deadpool I was looking for. Deadpool is notorious for being extremely unpredictable but he portrayed being much more predictable. Idk why I'm getting down voted for having a different opinion but it is what it is. \n\nhttp://youtu.be/CiJbDfTn9aI",

The average viewer thinks, \"Hey, that aircraft carrier had turbines on it just like in the Avengers\" not \"Hey, that aircraft carrier had turbines on it, but they didn't look exactly the same as the one in the Avengers so they must not be related.\" Marvel may not officially recognize it, but Fox is definitely leaving bread crumbs. \n\nAlso Ryan Reynolds put up a TV spot for Deadpool called [\"New TV spot.

            "body": "Well I'm no expert but I'll give it a try. Think of the actor's stage (even action movies are performed on a stage) as a 3d cube with 6 faces. The top is the roof (raise the roof), the bottom is the actual stage. The walls of the cube are where people can view the stage performance from. The performance is directed toward only one wall... the one facing the audience. The wings and the backstage are part of the show... they can watch the play, but the magic is broken for them, (ie. they hear cue calls, they see actors rushing past half-dressed, etc.). So in any play there are three pre-broken walls. This is just how I've always understood it in my own mind.\n\nThe fourth wall is supposed to never be broken, as the magic needs to keep going for the audience (\"the show must go on\") no matter what. However, if it's in line with the character and story, every once in a while you can get away with saying something to the audience ordinarily reserved for crew or fellows backstage/in the wings. You let the audience in on the reality of the play, and thereby break 'the magic' of the fourth wall. It is/was considered a risky move in theatre but can be quite memorable if played well.\n\nDeadpool takes this concept and beats it to death in the face just like he does his enemies. Maximum effort. He breaks the fourth wall like it's a bodily function. Almost to the point that, as many other more-Deadpool-savvy redditors have pointed out, he definitely knows he is a comic-book character and feels trapped by the fact he therefore knows he will/can never die.\n\nBut in terms of the movie, it is very rare or perhaps never been done (someone correct me?) where a scene was filmed that contained a fourth wall break, while 'within' a flashback scene of another fourth wall break. That is why he said the line \"that's like sixteen walls\" because he may be referring to the idea of a cube within a cube... often a flashback scene is played in the corner of a stage, so they technically have their own 'sub-stage', (sorry I'm really no expert), so breaking the wall within that would add more walls having been broken. But the number is wrong... no matter how I think about it... so my guess is that the final part to this joke is how famously bad Deadpool is at math.\n\nAnyways if you wanna know, during the part of the movie when Deadpool said \"Hey Jared... I'll take a footlong, fully loaded\" I kinda freaked out, since I am both idd Jared and I used to work at Subway. I didn't get the joke at first because I was reeling from trying to figure out if he was literally talking to me directly as some kind of new techno-prank or whatever. Also my date punched me in the arm when it happened so that didn't help.\n\nWhat a great fucking movie.\n\nTl/dr; Deadpool broke the 4th wall during a 4th wall flashback and knew it meant more broken walls but he's bad at math.\n\nEdit: Removed spoilers tags cuz I'm dumb",

My problem was that the movie is just dishonest and didn't really commit to its own premise - or at least what I perceived it to be. \n\nI have no familiarity at all with the source, haven't heard of Deadpool until the commercials so just wanted to get that out of the way.\n\nI got the sense that he's supposed to be this cool, take-shit-from-no-one type guy but I feel he's just petulant and kind of a loser in a sense. He seems to be marketed as an anti-hero but the movie obviously wants you to revere him in some way. All his cute witticisms just reminder me of some other characters that Ryan Reynolds plays-- kind of the 6th year senior Van Wilder type or his character in Waiting . They are these \"center of the universe\" type personalities who can't get their shit together are just losers when you look at them through a realistic lens. \n\nThis movie does the same thing that \"young adult\"/teen girl movies do like in Hunger Games (which I enjoyed actually for the world they created) where they gift these skills to a character who really hasn't done anything to deserve them. In this movie, he's this skilled veteran but really when you look at SEALs or anyone at a high level - they just don't exist as someone like him with his kind of attitude. \n\nAnd the girl is just silly. Probably should've been a Helena Bonham Carter, heroin'd-out type rather than the super clear-headed can have a collected conversation with an oncologist when that moment came but starts out the movie in that bar as a whore. Basically all her powers were in growing out her hair, I guess.\n\nAlso, the fact that they started out the movie kind of making fun of the genre with \"douche bag director\", \"english villian\" and all that stuff but they just play directly into it. A critic I saw on rotten tomatoes pointed out how Ryan Reynolds (which I understand why he needs to be the lead) is paired up with another very attractive villian actor - basically an example of how the movie isn't really as risk taking as they kind of want to make it seem. They follow the most formulaic plot possible and just throw in a bit of flashback type stuff as a change of pace.  \n\nThe movie seems like it was made with no effort besides making making sure it hits on meta jokes and twitter-type references. \n\n\nI don't think there's anything at all wrong with enjoying the movie and understand the movie isn't trying to compete against \"serious\" movies. The movie just is what it is - it still has middle school sensibilities and I really don't think it's comparable to something like the latest Mad Max at all -- I bring it up because of the post lumping Deadpool with Mad Max, a movie that created this very interesting world with unique imagery and characters. \n\nI don't think I look down on what I perceive Deadpool appeals to and as I've mentioned a few times, I think it's great and fine that people are into it. I kind of knew what I was getting into but I just feel like ultimately, the studio is playing their target audience rather than truly including them in on the joke.",

I understand it's insulting but I thought that's the clearest way to explain it and wanted to put it out there as a genuine opinion for folks who might think the same way -- basically that \"edgy\" feel. The movie tries to bring some realness to comic book movies but cannot commit at all -- the sensibilities are still childish, having tits and murder and language doesn't make it an adult-centered movie. The main love interest is a prostitute who hangs out with killers in the seediest of locations but still she can still pass as a kindergarten teacher when the movie gets to the more emotional parts of the movie. Movie tries to make fun of the genre a bit and act self aware but it still throws the most formulaic screenplay possible.",

Swearing is no different than any other repeated word ad nauseum. \n\nAnything can be too much and in a film when it's too much it's far too distracting. I feel as if the amount was to distract from the holes Deadpool has in the story telling that I'm sure they know exist. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why the torture segment of this film lasted as long as it did. They could've halved that time and put more effort in to building a relationship between him and her that hinged more on them and less on how many times on holidays they have sex and who can up the other. \n\nThe sex montage was far too long. Had it been shorter I wouldn't have figured out the \"gag\" of him being next to be plowed. It would've been funnier. Somethings were off time. \n\nNOT enough for me to find the film awful. I was afraid that they'd miss the mark on the humor and they didn't. I was afraid that they'd overdo the violence just to make it R and they didn't. It was enough without being over the top. \n\nPeople complain about silly Deadpool like in the video game and how that's not him. I think a good balance of him being silly and caustic would have been nice. I think it fell too heavily on the sarcasm weighed with swearing...it sounded (by the end of the film) as if I was listening to a valley girl except she swore in between the necessary words. \n\nIt is tiresome to come to /r/movies and finding out that in some instances it's like /r/politics where there's only one view and if that's not your view...you're not welcomed.

Don't be the one guy whos laugh everyone in the theater has nightmares about. \n\nEdit: Also, I didn't mean to shit on the guys because they were old, honestly probably not much older than me. I just pointed it out because of how much reddit complains about children in movie theaters, while these particular guys were basically reddit incarnate. ",

There was more male nudity than female, if I'm not mistaken (was impressed they actually showed the danglers during that fight scene).\n\nThe romance, though, and Baccarin's character could have been done better. She's a prostitute, cool. This is mentioned exactly once and immediately thereafter we're shown the relationship montage- it's great that they didn't show the sappy \"I'm going to quit walking the streets for you\" scene, but just having it assumed still isn't great for the character's depth.\n\nSo she goes straight from hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold to perfect nurturing suburban housewife- oh, and did I mention she's also a geek? \"Empire!\" Lol. I'm not sure whether it was her delivery or just the line itself, but I felt like it crossed the line from thematic banter to tasteless pandering for just a moment there.\n\nAnd then once he disappears, she goes back to... being a waitress?  At a *strip club*? I mean, sure, I can understand if she doesn't want to get back into hooking, but if that's the case a strip club should be the last place she'd want to work.\n\nShe has no apparent character flaws, and all around just felt too two-dimensional- given that I rolled my eyes at her lines a few times, I can see how women might feel the same.\n\nI heard that they didn't actually end up getting back together in the books- if her character doesn't ever really get developed there, it could explain why that's the case in the movie as well.",

It's about a postmodern a steak on the modern superhero film. Remember that superhero film with Will Smith called Hamilton? That was too early, because there's a serious fatigue about superheroes now, and formulaic films, such that this film is sort of meta-level. You can say it's a film for an audience of hipsters, a jaded group of people tired of being spoon-fed stupid stories about the same thing over and over. Yes, I get a tragic irony from the fact that it is that same formula making fun of itself, but what are you gonna do?

Not because of the reason you listed. \n\nYou were downvoted because what you said is cringeworthy. It boils down to \"My manly movie dont give a shit about those feminazis trying to ruin Hollywood.\"\n\nYou're praising something for being the rule. Star wars and mad max were praised for being the exception. \"Side stepping the gender issue\" is what most movies do. It's nothing special. I hate when movies force characters in for the sake of diversity. If Max in Mad Max were made a girl for the sake of having a strong female cast I'd be pissed. That said, i love Furiosa and what she brings to the movie. \n\nBasically, Deadpool is like most movies in that it doesnt make an effort to include stronger women. You praising it for having a woman that needs to be saved is neckbeard to the max. Someone complaining about it having a woman to save is just as ridiculus in my mind. It's a non-issue.

DoFP fractures the time lines effectively changing all of the events of X1-3 and the wolverine (Japan one) allowing them to go on and save the world with largely the original team from X1. \n\nHowever, the first class, dofp story will continue into apocalypse however in a different time line, effectively independent of the other films. \n\nConfusing the fuck out of anyone that doesn't care enough to pay more than the normal amount of attention to these films. I think the success of these films has largely been a fluke - not at all well planned. \n\nEDIT: which is why deadpool can run away with it and make that joke.

There is a clear distinction between critically assessing a film and doing it from a casual perspective of \"*Component X and Y is so funny, so Film Z is a success*\" that skips over everything from Component A to W.\n\nAnd if we're going to get into the semantics of what is and what isn't an \"excellent Deadpool\", I can do that too. This *Deadpool* isn't the Deadpool from the comics. Beyond the gore, the comics would be at the extreme end of a PG-13 film. It relied less on swearing and nudity; the film says \"Fuck nuance\" and exploits the R-rating for all the manchildren who are under the assumption Deadpool is supposed to have these things.\n\nThe comics had a more nuanced Deadpool that straddled the fine line between between being an asshole and an asshole that was trying to redeem himself (and failing); film Deadpool is simply an irredeemable asshole. The Wade Wilson in the comic books never had a sense of humour until after the Weapon X program drove him mad and into becoming the Merc With A Mouth; film Wade Wilson was a motor-mouth even before he became Deadpool. I'd get into how important Weasel and Blind Al are to Deadpool's characterization and how their underutilization is a detriment in the film, but I suspect it'll fall on deaf ears.\n\nAre we still going to discuss how a film should be judged based on everything a film is supposed to encompass and/or pretend you know about what constitutes a proper Deadpool story/film?",

I've been there I know that sometimes you don't have a choice and it sucks but that's it. Other than that yeah Vanessa wasn't as fleshed out as she should have been , that's why romantic interests in action movies are always super lame for me. I'd rather the female supporting character not be a romantic interest at all so that the writers would be forced to think about something else when it comes to her personality and relationship with the male lead. What comes to mind is Emily Blunt in Edge of Tomorrow until the very last act. She was fully fleshed out and could stand on her own. \n\nAs for the Vanessa being a geek that made think about 'Gone Girl' which I've been reading at a painfully slow pace for almost two years (I only read in public transports, sometimes I don't, sometime I fell asleep) and there was this part about \"cool girls\" girls who pretend to like whatever their SO is into because it's cool, and men like cool girls.\n\nI feel like whenever there's a female character of significant importance in a script, there has to be at least two or more female writers in a room overseeing what lines and how they will deal with that character. To make it less uni dimensional and more believable.  ",

My personal bias is that, most of the things that I post are links to stuff that I've created. I usually browse through comments with the following philosophy about comments:\n\n- positive fluff: nice but I very quickly peruse\n- Positive criticism: GOLD, I carefully review these\n- negative criticism: I try to keep my ego in check and pay attention to these\n- negative fluff: I pretend it's not there/ downvote\n\nHope that helps explain my rationale and that again, you didn't take offense.

Being extreme, and over-the-top just to be extreme and over-the-top. \"I'm breaking the 4th wall for the millionth time, isn't that funny?\" Even 16 year old me didn't care much for Dead Pool when he first came out. This is really a film for teens and young adults who love childish South Park type humor. Everyone else will have pretty mixed feelings about it.\n\nThat said, the movie moved along at a fair pace. I liked Colossus, and his big heart playing straight man to Dead Pool's slapstick antics. I've always thought that the chick playing Wade's girlfriend was hot since seeing her in Firefly and then Homeland (and now Gotham). I liked the hat tip to Ferris Bueller's Day Off. I got all of the 80s references, cause I'm old like that. And I have to admit that there were one or two scenes that I found legitimately funny enough to laugh out loud to, but most of it got barely a chuckle from me. \n\nFor me, personally, this film was WAAAAAY over-hyped, but I sort of figured that going into it.",

I strongly believe these movies dont deserve to be lauded because they are presenting women in a way a very vocal minority prefers them to be. A woman being the main character of Star Wars is completely cool but the fact they wrote a full blown Mary Sue with zero flaws is silly imo. That was the creator's vision though. Who am I to try and change that?\n\nIts funny you think neckbeard as some ad hominem. I m not fat, out of shape or neckbearded.\n\nI am not like the PC crowd, I don't want to censor or eliminate art I don't agree with. I want people free to make the most PC feminist movies they can think of. I also want someone to be able to make the most non-pc, conservative movie. I abhor their goal of eliminating the damsel in distress trope because it is as old as human story telling. Im happy it isnt disappearing because of bullying from a very small minority of silly people.\n\nMy wife loved Jurassic Park flick because she thought the Parks & Recs guy was a hot badass. She didn't like Fury Road, thought it was gross. I liked mad max more than her. It isnt just men who prefer the traditional stuff sometimes. A lot of it speaks to our biology.\n",

He's had something of a revolving door when it comes to his supporting cast unfortunately.\n\nI'm just happy the film draws so much from Joe Kelly's work both in terms of plot and thematically.

How can I take you seriously after that? You can't seem to wrap your head around the fact that this wasn't supposed to be some fantastic pinnacle of cinema. It did what it set out to be and the resounding response should make that pretty crystal clear. \n\nYou clearly didn't like the humor employed in this film, which is totally fine, and went in with the mindset that it was supposed to be something it was not. If you want to look at it specifically from a technical aspect, devoid of any other metrics, yes, it wasn't the best film in the world. What I and many others agree with, is that it was a good Deadpool movie because that's what it was trying to be. I'm not even going to get into your laughable excuses for why it isn't a Deadpool movie. I honestly cannot fathom the person who watched the trailers for this movie, then left the theater and complained about it by taking out *exactly what was at the center of the fucking movie and the center of the trailers*. It's like buying a Toyota Corolla and calling it a shitty car for not being as fast as a Mustang. They're two different things. \n\nIt's completely within reason to say you didn't like the humor and thus didn't enjoy the movie, but to call it a bad movie from the perspective of removing all those humorous aspects (such as the jokes and Ryan Reynolds performance) is just ridiculous man.

I blame the budget.  \n\nIt was beyond great for what it had to work with though, just a shame that the budget kept it from being as great as it could have been.  The original final battle was MUCH more huge and epic than the one in the movie, but much more expensive to shoot too.

Whether it's Deadpool saving his girl, Finn saving Rey, or any gender combination of rescuers and rescued. We most commonly see men saving women, and i dont think that's a bad thing. However, seeing the opposite is an interesting change of pace. I just hate for this to happen for the sake of being able to play the \"girl power\" card in marketing. \n\nI also feel that we cant really comment on Rey's character traits until the end of the trilogy. She'll more than likely have some personal flaws to overcome on her hero's journey. Further, she is not the only character with a \"perfect\" personality. Poe is openly welcoming to a former enemy and seems like a golden boy throughout. I'd agree with your dislike of Rey for being one dimensional if she were the only character like that; Poe being the same way ruins that for me. But hey, for all i know, you dont like Poe either. \n\nAnyway, glad we could discusd this. When i say neckbeard i basically use it as the opposite of an SJW. And even though SJWs dont have to be on the extreme side, people most commonly use the term to describe the extreme ones. I didnt really think you were fat with a hairy neck.  ",

So i would get sent home from work sick sometime before lunchtime (public facing work it was).\n\nThe last thing i wanted then was a 2 hour train ride, so i'd get of the train 2 stops away from work in the CBD and go to the cinemas. Cool, dark, nearly no interpersonal interaction, perfect.   \n\nNow, i find a solo cinema trip to be the perfect mental, physical and emotional recharge. \n\nDoesn't mean i don't like to go to the cinema with people also, but going alone is also very nice.  \n\nWhile it is not \"peace and quiet\" insofar as a movie can be loud and flashy... it is peace and quiet insofar as it is around two hours of pure \"no distraction, no worries\".\n\nWatching a movie at home, unless it's way too late at night (in which case volume is then often an issue), is always interrupted by kids or other such things.  At home i feel obliged to pause and respond to that email, text, phonecall, IM.  At the cinema there's always \"i was in a movie\" and it's not just OK to ignore your phone, it's positively encouraged.",

Matt & Trey must have known that was going to be a common occurrence, considering how the film opens with the boys going to see 'Terrance & Phillip: Asses of Fire'.\n\nThat same rule also resulted in my grandmother having to see 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' with me when I was 15.

            "body": "I take an issue that a lot of Kelly's characterization of Deadpool in the film is used sparingly; it briefly comes and goes depending on what a particular scene or sequence in the film requires of the character. In the more intimate and heartfelt parts, it shines and elevates the character; such as Wade returning to Blind Al's place after losing his hand and the few scenes the two share afterwards, or even the brief moments Wade shares with Weasel in the bar.\n\nBut when the script requires a more 'frenetic' Deadpool, the film slips into tinges of Way's run. There's clear tonal dissonance at these times; one moment Tim Miller's Buster Keaton-esque visual gags of abusing Wade's super regen, Deadpool's quips, and references seem natural, and at other moments, everything seems pandering as the film strangles the R-rating for maximum profit.\n\nAs for the irredeemable asshole bit, you might be right. It might require another viewing before I can better appreciate what is being done with Wade in film. But as it is, I'm relatively disheartened over the whole reliance on pedestrian humor. If they retain Kelly's iteration of Deadpool completely for the sequel, it might blow me away.\n\nIt's like I said in my original post, there was a lot of potential here. Not only in crafting a unique superhero film, but in doing something different even compared to the comic books. Embrace Joe Kelly's Deadpool fully. Utilize Blind Al, Weasel, Vanessa and the other supporting characters to their full potential. Balance out the humor. And I agree with you that this is a relatively accurate translation of Deadpool from paper to film compared to *most* iterations of the character, but it can be better, more accurate. There is always room for improvement.",

Even my thoughts on the film [3 days ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/moviescirclejerk/comments/44vffk/uj_so_i_watched_deadpool_uj/) praised the humor and Reynolds' performance.

I don't have stats to back this up, only observations while working in one of the biggest local theater around my place or even as a moviegoer going on opening days or the busiest day of the week by  looking at the crowd. And sometimes I feel like there has to be a way to bring the female audience in. Whether if it's in better story telling, more diverse cast, or better known actors, or even the marketing. Bar super established ids like Star Wars, blockbusters heavy on action let alone R rated action movies, haven't been doing well enough to bring more people in. Maybe it's just me, maybe I should read stats, attend movies on a different day, or maybe people aren't all meant to all enjoy the same things.",

If you have a trash can outside of every theater (a very common practice), and people are expected to take their trash to those trash cans, like civilized people, the only thing that employees have to do is sweep. This is much much faster than sweeping AND also spending time to walk the rows and pick up all of the trash left behind. The quicker a movie can be cleaned, the quicker managers can schedule the next showing to start after it. This also means that it will be quicker to get the people waiting for the next showing in the theater so they're not overcrowding the lobby. Ultimately, this results in 1) more movies scheduled which means more ticket sales and concession revenue for the cinema and 2) less overcrowding in the lobby so the customers have a better experience.\n\nIt is undoubtedly inefficient to not have trash cans inside every theater and to also have trash cans every two or three theaters down the hall, and also have trash cans in the lobby.

I think the foundations of it are definitely there.\n\nOn a side note, I kind of get why they didn't include Deadpool struggling with the idea of killing Ajax ala Kelly's run in the movie. I think in a movie context, that might have come off as a tad derivative as the \"superheroes don't kill\" trope has become a bit cliche over the years. I think it was a good idea to throw that particular arc to the side for the time being. For an introductory movie, I think establishing such a gleefully amoral character in a superhero movie was a good idea. Now that Deadpool's violent streak has been established, now I think in a sequel it would be a good idea to subvert that again and have him struggle with his morals more. \n\nOn another positive note, I will say that what I was worried about - and something A LOT of Deadpool comics do - is that they would make him goofy and incompetent. It's something that so many Deadpool books too. Since he's crazy and humorous, automatically he has to be a useless, bumbling clown. Thankfully, probably my favorite aspect of the film was that Wade was hyper competent, scarily efficient and damn near unstoppable (even if his healing factor was significantly toned down for the better).\n\n",

By taking those out of the equation and then shitting on it is silly. \n\n>Notice how I then brought up everything I believed were negatives in the next paragraph after removing the R-rating and Reynolds' performance?\n\nVery astute of you and get this, *I did* notice that other paragraph full of words. Your criticism's, although not wrong, are hardly a surprise. This is an *origin* story, so the focus being on Deadpool rather than the supporting characters isn't surprising. Jumping to the conclusion of Colossus just killing himself because he'll have nothing to do for the subsequent sequels is a leap that has no logical consistency. Maybe let Deadpool develop in his origin story and see where the next movie takes the supporting characters? Along this line as well, did you expect this to me some tense, well done revenge story like Blue Ruin or something? I just don't understand criticizing it for being a generic revenge story, when the trailers pretty much said it was going to be a generic revenge story. \n\n>I don't see anything wrong with challenging the prevalent nerd sentiment that Deadpool is some kind of unique cinematic revelation.\n\nWhere has some said this was a cinematic revelation? It sounds to me like you're creating an argument against something that doesn't exist. Almost all the reviews for the movie have just said it was a super fun and entertaining movie. No one is claiming it's cinematically marvelous, it's just fucking fun *because* of the liberties they had with an R-rating and the outstanding performance from Reynolds. \n\n>Like I've said three times now; you can't seem to wrap your head around what I'm saying. \n\nNo, I know exactly what you're saying. Your trying to be some enlightened critic who claims it's a bad movie because of its generic structure, sans the comedic elements. I'm not saying you're wrong, but your argument is largely irrelevant because no one is claiming it's some type of Superhero genre changing movie. The comments about it being a breath of fresh air amongst the superhero movie spectacle are because it pokes fun at superhero movies, actually shows visceral violence, and could use crude, foul jokes. That hasn't been the case in any superhero movie as of recent, so *it is* a breath of fresh air. \n\n>I've come to accept how some people (on Reddit) can't compute the more critical facet of looking at films\n\nYeah, this holier than thou attitude you're giving off makes perfect sense. I'll leave you with this: who the fuck is trying to look at this movie critically? I mean really? There are some movies that deserve to be looked at critically like Ex-Machina and then there are those that absolutely do not need to be looked at critically because the movie was made *solely* for entertainment and fun. If you want to look at *Deadpool* critically, go ahead. You're absolutely not wrong in your analysis, but it's an analysis that no one is really looking for. If you look at *Deadpool* as a sum of its parts, which include its R-rating and Reynolds performance, you get a very entertaining movie that is fun to just sit down and watch. Not look into critically or anything more than surface level because it makes no attempt to be that type of movie. \n\nAgain, you're not wrong man. It is a generic revenge movie that didn't really do anything crazy with its plot. What I'm saying is, trying to remove the quality parts of the movie and look at it the way you're doing is dumb. Its a fucking Deadpool movie. It did exactly what it was trying to do and that was be a fun movie. Not technically incredible, just fun. ",

He has decent lines with good timing, and I can live with that and enjoy it. \n\nAs for what the mechanics of good timing are, that's a much broader subject than just talking about Deadpool. But really its more in the delivery and timing of his jokes than the content of the jokes. Shit like the baby hand stroking Al's chin was so well timed. It was unexpected and weird, but fucking hilarious and had my theater laughing so hard I could barely hear the lines of what he was saying. It just depends on what you find funny, and a lot of Deadpool's humor is absurd with good timing. \n\nThe most flat jokes in the movie were the easily anticipated ones, and they felt especially out of place given his normal humor is supposed to be absurd, not cliche.",

He never mentions anything about meeting random people.  Never mentions his age.  He never said he liked to watch the audience laugh.  I don't remember them mentioning Deadpool's flexible sexuality.  His girlfriend wasn't meta.  Deadpool doesn't care about meeting people at all.  Or what other people think.  You just are too up your own backside to admit that you're wrong for butting in and your information was wrong.  ",
