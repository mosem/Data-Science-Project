That's great, and I look forward to diving into all that. I still don't think that's an excuse to whittle down his character to a plot device and little more in the film. They could have at least given us a minute or so of extra scenes with him to build him up a bit more to the film audience. I understand there's a massive cast in this and they can't spend a lot of time on everyone, but Saw, according to the film itself, seems like one of the most important characters in the whole film.",

I squealed like a girl when Red Leader popped up on the screen.\n\n3. Along the same lines, going in almost entirely spoiler free made for a much more enjoyable experience.  I had only seen the first trailer and avoided everything else.  Glad I did. After having so much of TFA spoiled I intend to resist for EP8\n\n4. Tarkin CGI was good but uncanny valley is still a problem. The lighting was a little off too, like he was on a more lit environment than everyone else. Leia's model was not as good as Tarkin but that was only one shot so it's no biggie. \n\n5. Perfect amount of screen time for Vader though JEJ's voice is just not what it was in the 80s. A little weaker with age and the delivery was a little too sassy compared to how he played the part in the OT. Still cool though and his final sequence was awesome.\n\n6. Loved the way \"Rogue One\" was created, given a heroic death for each member and lionized for the future. \n\n7. Great music: perfect mix of homage to Williams, usage of Williams and it's own thing. Giachinno is definitely the guy to replace Williams when the inevitable day comes.\n\n8. Moved slowed down a little too much in the middle but the final stretch was perfect. Best final battle in a star wars movie since ROTJ\n\n9. K2SO was hilarious \n\n10. Love the reference to the Whills and the incorporation of Jedi mythology. Helped the movie retain its place in the universe despite being such a different kind of Star Wars film.\n\nOverall 9/10. Great movie, can't wait for EP8\n",

And they expanded upon it perfectly with new locations, aliens, weapons, etc.\n\n- The visuals are astounding. Beautiful cinematography and VFX. And all those wonderful designs! Darth Vader's hideout looked like something straight from Ralph McQuarie's sketchbook and all the aliens were neat.\n\n- There was less fan service and nostalgia pandering compared to The Force Awakens (though it was definitely present)\n\n- The ending was perfect. It did not shy away from character deaths and it tied things up wonderfully, leaving us where Ep. IV starts.\n\n- We finally get to see Darth Vader kick some serious ass. You know which scene I mean. He was fucking terrifying. \n\n- We also see a lot more of the Empire\n\n- Ben Mendelhson stole the show for me along with Donnie Yen. \n\n- The score felt very much like a Star Wars score.\n\nThe cons:\n\n- The story is a bit all over the place and the pacing is off. The first half of the movie feels at odds with the beach planet finale. I think Rogue One could easily have been 20 minutes shorter and better paced without losing any important story beats.\n\n- Neither the script nor the acting are perfect although neither gets anywhere near the high prequel levels of cringe.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Rogue One is a visual feast which captures the Star Wars feel perfectly. It serves as a great proof of concept for these standalone anthology films.\n\n- It is not without issues of script and pacing, but these issues don't detract much from the overal very positive experience.\n\nPS: Please excuse bad English and misspelled actor names.\n\n",

            "body": "I enjoyed the shit out this film. It's not perfect, but none of the Star Wars films are ... except for maybe Empire. \n\nThis just hit so many interesting points that I personally find really, really interesting as a Star Wars fan. I loved the morally grey area of the Rebellion in their drive to succeed. When Cassian says, \"I've done terrible things for the Rebellion\", I felt so at home. There was a level of complexity to the opposing forces that we haven't seen before. It's still \"Good vs Evil\" but done in a way that has enough shading to make it more interesting than we've ever seen. On the same note, I actually quite liked Orson Krennic as a villain because he wasn't ideological; he was a straight-up careerist. He felt like a politician doing whatever he can to rise the ranks. This felt very believable to me, as we have real life figures who are exactly like that, and I had no real problem with him as an antagonist. I've also been a big Mendelsohn fan since Animal Kingdom and happy to see him in more things. \n\nThe battles were incredible. Best in the film series. It really put you on the ground and focused on the blow by blow of each scenario. I was also just so on board with seeing all of these Rebel troops just pushing amongst all of the carnage and destruction to do their small part in a larger battle. In fact, Jyn and Cassian's final moments felt very moving to me; they didn't *stop* the Death Star, but they succeeded in their mission and that was enough. They were a \"small\" part of a much larger story, but absolutely integral to it and that was actually rather moving to me. \n\nThe cinematography was amazing. Some of the best in the series. Anyone who says these films can't be shot digitally is kidding themselves. Shot on the Arri Alexa 65, which The Revenant used to large effect, and vintage Ultra Panavision 70 lenses. Actually looked more textured and interesting than The Force Awakens, a film shot on film. \n\nCGI Tarkin was distracting, but Leia actually looked STUNNING ... until she spoke. But I was so blown away by her, though. They did a great job there. And VADER .... That'll be an all time classic Star Wars scene for years to come. Very, very happy overall. \n\ntl;dr - shit's good.

The whole battle on Scarif was visceral and different from anything I've ever seen in Star Wars. It really had a great impact on me in the sense of just how many deaths and sacrifices are made to complete even one mission in war. \n\nFelicity Jones, Diego Luna, and Riz Ahmed were all good, but I don't think any of their performances really stood out, despite all three of them being great actors. I found myself not really caring about any of them until the last 20 minutes or so. Donnie Yen was badass but his dialogue felt really stilted at times. Forest Whitaker just seemed...off. Last Vader scene was just badass. \n\nMy favorite performance by far was Ben Mendelsohn as Krennic. He was incredible  \u2013 I absolutely hated Krennic but was still so engrossed by him. He also was stylish as fuck.",

You made two incredible Star Wars movies so far with Episode 7 and definitely Rogue One. You made it dark and didn't take the safe route. That is definitely the darkest Stars Wars yet. You made me care about these characters which we have almost no backstory on. I can't stand you cause you killed ALL of them off. I know it had to be done, but still is absolutely heartbreaking.

It would've been higher if the music was on par with the rest of the saga.\n\n**Characters** \n\nFor the most part, I liked the characters and found myself cheering for their success. I understand that some weren't able to connect with them because they weren't as developed. But I would argue that this movie left little room for development; maybe it would have been possible with less Saw and Tarkin.\n\nMy top three favorite characters were K2SO, Chirrut, and Cassian. I wish we could get some of their backstories at some point in the near future.\n\n**Story**\n\nIt was simplistic and I wish there were more twists in the tale. But I guess that's usually how Star Wars movies are supposed to be. Darth Vader left me absolutely speechless! I couldn't have asked for it any other way. The ending was tragic and the losses left me hollow. I wanted to know more about the characters, where they would find themselves afterwards!\n\nI agree with others about those cuts to different planets. It was like the screenwriter didn't know where to focus his attention. Some are complaining that the first 2/3 was too slow. But there wasn't a point in the story where I sat there thinking, \"Well, geez this is boring.\" I liked the way they set things up, especially going into that final battle at Scarif where they did not have the support of the Rebel Alliance.The slower parts attempted to show the darker sides of the rebellion and how their victories weren't always without shades of grey. Rebellions can get messy when people bring different perspectives. And desperation can be a curse.\n\nI'm thrilled with this installment! It is an important part of the SW lore. Jedis, Siths, and lightsabers *define* Star Wars, but RO elevates it. The story of these unsung heroes, with all of their bravery and imperfections, brings a sense of humanity to the franchise. \n\n**TDLR:** Overall, great movie and I can't wait to rewatch it a few more times!",

But by the end I was warming up to her character and then BOOM.\n\nI would've liked them to add a bit more development for  the team.\n\nSaw Gerrera - Sorry this one was the character I least cared for.\n\nBattle scenes - Loved it, I could SEE things happen. \nLoved the little tie ins to the upcoming movies and some obvious ones.\n\nVader - YES, YES... that last scene is ALL I needed to establish WHY this guys name sent shivers down peoples spine.

The entirety of the third act had me with a stupid grin on my face, though. I really liked the anti-Hollywood bittersweet ending, it was a nice break from, say, a Marvel film, that kills off one minor hero every dozen movies or so. However I did have an issue with when Cassian seemingly dies after getting shot and eating shit down that big shaft. I really liked the sudden, unpredictable death of a character there, it is a war after all. But no, he got better and showed up just in time to save Jyn and then embrace and die together. In conclusion, I wanted to see more Vader in action, I wish it weren't so exposition heavy towards the start, but overall a solid film. 7/10.\n\nOh, and the R2 and C-3PO cameos seemed out of place, they should've been seen aboard the ship at the end, if they were in it at all.",

            "body": "First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, I thought Gareth Edwards expressed a far wider and more ambitious vision of the star wars universe than JJ Abrams whilst still being respectful to the OT (unlike TFA). I thought that the acting all around was pretty solid, apart from maybe felicity Jones lack of emotional depth and forest Whittaker's overacting. The visuals were stunning to me (taking the best features from the prequels and the OT really paid off) and I didn't actually find Tarkin to be too distracting. I found his and Krennic's interactions very interesting as they highlighted the differing views and conflict within the empire\n\nI thought the plot was excellent and that although the trailers did give away too much, there were layers I wasn't expecting, however I do agree with the complaints about pacing in acts 1 and 2. This may have been because there was very little breathing room for the audience, for example I cannot remember a single scene in the movie that did not set up a future plot point or service a characters arc. This meant there were very few moments set aside from the main narrative where the audience could relax. The score was undoubtedly lacking and the only times it did resonate with me were when they re-used the original music, although even this was re-mixed. I thought that maybe some of the iconic moments, like the two star destroyers colliding would have been far more impressive (although it was great already) with better music. Fan service is also an issue however I accept it is just a little fun for us fans.\n\nI believe Vader was handled excellently, although like most I believe he was slightly under-utilised as this may be the last time we see him properly in action. One general complaint that I have however is with reshoots, and many scenes from the trailers not being seen in the final cut. I can forgive this to an extent as I believe it did not negatively affect the movie in any drastic way, however I would have liked to have seen some scenes (such as Krennic walking across the beach on scarif) in the final cut. Also some of the writing in the movie seems a bit on the nose, one too may inspirational speeches etc. I think this may be because the writing felt simple in that it is used as an expositional tool in every scenario to show how a character feels or what will happen next in the narrative. It just seems a bit predictable as what a character says just reflects exactly what sort of person they are, it's just a little too deliberate or predictable? I'm not sure, but it felt a bit off to me.\n \nMy biggest praise for this movie however is the success Edwards made in the introduction of a plethora of new themes and ideas in the movie whilst still making it feel like a natural prologue to a new hope and the rest of the series. Some of my favourite new ideas included the extremist rebel groups and how they differed from the alliance, and the idea of Donnie Yen's character being in touch with the force, without actually being able to wield it. I believe these achievements should be recognised and greatly commended, and the actions of Abrams in TFA addressed (I understand that the issues with TFA have been talked to death, however I believe it is important to bring them up now in light of rogue one's release).\n\nIn general I believe this 'experiment' was a great success, with excellent action, narrative, generally solid characters and masterful introduction of new tech, ships and ideas that did not feel particularly forced. However I do believe people need to wake up to the fact that, although enjoyable, TFA was certainly nothing new and that if we as fans wish for the star wars franchise to grow and evolve into something better, we must recognise the shortfalls of both rogue one and TFA and voice our support for the successful additions in these movies. I did not mean for this post to be a rant however it frustrates me when I see critics and fans singing the praises of TFA, when to me the movie seems rather uninspiring and just a childish effort to forget about the prequels and start anew. However when rogue one actually tries something fresh, people criticise it for arguably irrelevant things such as Tarkin's CGI. Personally I would rather have a star wars movie that tries out some new themes and character's, and makes mistakes on the way, instead of a movie like TFA which simply re-treads old ground while making little or no mark of its own.\n \n\n\n",

You'd be mistaken for thinking that the star destroyers were actual models rather than CGI. \n\nHowever, pacing is off. They really, really rush the first third. They throw so many names of characters and planets at you, you can get lost in trying to follow the plot and who to care for. \n\nThis then makes the final third suffer as you don't care when everyone dies. \n\nThe quickest comparison I can think of is Saving Private Ryan. You (at least I did) were attached to the squad saving private Ryan and it hit hard when each soldier met their doom. \n\nHere, in rogue one, it's a little too breezy and you don't get that sense of loss one should have. Maybe they weren't dramatic enough I don't know. \n\nA solid movie though. A brilliant \"Star Wars story\" but not quite a great \"Star Wars\" movie, if you catch my drift. \n\n\n\nP.S.

I really think it's worth it for the finale but I felt underwhelmed with everything up to the title drop.\n\n\nK-2SO is great. He's like a Chewie bot with the smarm of C3PO.\n\n\nWhat's Chirrut and Baze doing? Why are they helping? Why do they show up? As cool as they are, why should I care about them? Because they are fucking cool, but like besides their temple getting stripped down and blown up I really don't end up knowing a lot about them.\n\n\nThe universe building is great. When they use puppets and/or costumes and capture the aesthetic of the initial trilogy it's fantastic. Also the way the rebellion is a bit morally grayer (orders to kill Galen, for example) was also really well done and Krennic as a bumbling desperate bureaucrat worked becaus all his superiors were so much more threatening than him.\n\n\nJyn goes from not caring to completely caring after one message from her father. It's a \"tell not show\" moment and to me its unconvincing as a huge segment of her character development happens in about 3 minutes. She does sort of develop more, as does Andor, but the characters overall I didn't get to connect with in a way I did with Finn or Kylo Ren, where that development and moment of challenge is a lot more developed and convincing (and furthermore shown, not told).\n\n\nI liked the scene right after Galen's death where Jyn confronts Andor, since it really laid out the stakes for each character and the moment and did a bit more of a convincing job of convincing me that these people are real people. But ultimately it was really the one convincing moment in a sea of sort of tropey moments that overall didn't sell me on these people.\n\n\nThe final action act was pure delight.",

            "body": "Disclaimer : I'm better at critiquing than I am at saying what I liked, so I'll preface this by saying I liked the movie, all in all. But a few things did bother me:\n\nCharacter development: the sacrifices at the end felt a little forced because I feel like they didn't develop the characters enough. There were 6 ''main'' characters in the squad, who all needed to be introduced to the audience and to each other, which left them all lacking in personality. I think they should've cut/merged a few characters to allow us to love the remaining more. I also felt the 2nd act was a bit unnecessary: the whole part about the girl being busted out of prison and then the extremists... I thought they should've changed that, all in favor of needing less exposition and allowing more development. \n\nCGI Leia was a tad ugly, as was Darth Vaders voice when he met with Tarkin. Not the biggest issue, but I noticed. \n\nDidn't love the acting of our main character. Felt like she had just the 1expression on her face. \n\nWhat I did love: the choice of killing everyone, the scene with DV killing the rebels in the corridor. The last act was pretty good, probably the best of the movie. \n\nMore general criticism: I would've liked it if they had a chosen a bit of a different story. I feel like the Star Wars universe is a bit obsessed with the whole ''I'm an orphan and my parents are special'' bit: how cool would it be if we had followed the story of that blind monk, joining the rebellion after the empire destroyed the temple he was supposed to protect? I don't know, I guess I wanted something a bit riskier. ",

By this I mean the ordering to kill Galen and the Rogue volunteers  saying they had done stuff they wish they could forget. It also showed a more casualties of war side of....star WARS. Your entire main cast dies for the greater good. I liked that. Although I thought K2 might have been back like a body switch with that other droid he hacked. But once a few of them dropped I realized he aint coming back and they will all die. Scariff was visually very pleasing as opposed to straight sand planets that seem to be the majority of the galaxy. Vader....god ...fucking...damn dude.....he tore the rebels a new arse. I was thinking at the end that he didnt have as big of a role as I thought he would and then he showed up to murder everyone. Overall its a great addition to the Star Wars storyline in my opinion. I liked the C3PO/R2D2 cameo and whilst they are the only characters to appear in all the films I just realized a Siths lightsaber is also seen in all films whilst this film being the only one to not have a Jedi's saber.

            "body": "Glad this is finally up. Saw it Monday and it has sucked not being able to talk with anyone about it, haha.\n\nI review a fair number of movies. I usually try to stay pretty objective, and review them from the perspective of \"What do audiences want to see?\" because, personally, I'm, as one of my friends jokes, one of \"those pretentious New Yorker writers\". I'm a stickler for story, and characterization, and my own personal feelings of movies is often far harsher than the content of my published reviews. But, nobody wants to read somebody nitpicking, lol. They just want to know whether or not to go see a movie.\n\nBut this movie made me feel like a little kid again. I was smiling like a doofus and even tearing up at points. This is the movie I've wanted since I was a little kid in 1983, watching them on my grandfather's Betamax.\n\nLoved the tone and the world-building, while still staying within the confines of the original trilogy. To me, this was the most authentic Star Wars experience we've had in film/television form since 1983. The planets and characters all felt like Star Wars.\n\nBut I also liked that they did a great job evolving the universe a little, too. The original films never quite captured the feel of a galaxy that is slowly being submitted by an Empire that has supplanted a more free Republic. This film got that. The Empire doesn't just feel cartoonishly evil (\"Let's go blow up this planet to show them we're serious\"). This film might have been helped by being a product of its time. I think modern filmmakers are a bit more in tune to the nature of imperialism. I definitely liked that it didn't go overboard with Nazi-esque iconography and aryan characters like TFA did. TFA's characterization of the First Order was laughably cheap and stupid. \n\nEnsemble cast was good. I thought the characters were a little shallow, but this was a Dirty Dozen type movie. Fully fleshed out characters weren't really needed. All we needed to know was that they had a mission, and a reason to be on that mission. I thought that was properly established. I thought they overdid Yen's blind swordsman bit a little too much (Storm Troopers charging in to get beaten down like extras in a Bruce Lee film) and the Stormtrooper Blaster Special machine-laser seemed to be a bit too powerful in some scenes (really? He just hit 8 guys at once?). Small gripe though. \n\nLoved the callbacks. Gold Leader and Red Leader were my favorite. So small, so subtle, and even simple since it just reused footage, lol, and yet a lovingly perfect nod to the original film. The shot of the U-Wing leaving Yavin and flying past the same guard tower, again, great. \n\nCGI Tarkin had a little too much screen time, though I liked the inclusion of the character. Some people thought he undercut the main villain too much, but I didn't have a problem with it. Actually gave Krennic some extra motivation to watch as his glory was getting stolen by others. And we knew Tarkin was going to end up as the Death Star commander anyway. Gave some reasonable context to his arrogance in the original film. CGI Leia didn't look that great, but a small, short scene.\n\nThe final act was the kind of fan service this movie was *made for*. Loved seeing the \"plain ole\" X-Wings and Y-Wings dueling with \"plain ole\" TIE Fighters. I mean, those things are so iconically Star Wars, and we haven't seen them in a movie since 1983. Plus, watching 2016 CGI animating a battle with all of our 70s and 80s favorites? \n\nThe Tantive IV escaping the battle wasn't the best narrative choice, especially given some of the contextual cues of A New Hope (eg, Princess Leia trying to convince Vader she was on a diplomatic mission, on a ship that would have just been spotted at a battle).\n\nI think a better end to the movie would have been the escaped Rebels handing over the plans to Leia as the Tantive IV met them at Tattooine, then Vader's star destroyer emerging from hyperspace and chasing Leia's. \n\n\nCan't completely gush though. The story is a bit stilted, and some of the scenes move from location to location without good enough setup. I think a lot of the reshoots might have caused that. It's not bad enough that it seriously damages the film, but it's noticeable. \n\nThe rest are little nitpicky things I don't want to end up debating for hours with people, lol. \n\nOverall though, it's a solid \"A\" grade movie. It works as a Star Wars movie, but more importantly, it works as a *movie*. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe a little cliche, definitely treading on familiar ground, but what isn't these days? ",

            "body": "Overall, I liked the movie far more than the prequels, but far less than any of the OT or TFA.\n\nPros:\n\n- Final act was awesome.\n- Vader was used to a perfect amount. His first scene isn't written or executed so well, but damn, the buildup to that final slaughter was amazing. That's the scene we've been waiting ages to see, and we finally got it.\n- The droid and Donnie Yen's character were awesome.\n- I liked how \"D&D\" the cast synergy felt.\n- Like TFA and Empire Strikes Back, it had just the right amount of levity in humor, and in the right places.\n- The new locales and technology were pretty sweet.\n- The action scenes were fantastic.\n\nCons:\n\n- The dialogue went anywhere from \"pretty good\" to \"exceptionally cringeworthy\".\n- The first act is horribly paced and super messy and jittery.\n- The cast was flat and almost entirely forgettable. And because of that, when they overdramatized many of their deaths, it felt fake and forced. It feels so weird how after a single watch of TFA, I knew all the characters' names off the top of my head. I feel like the only two characters I remembered the names of this time were Jyn and Galen--and Galen wasn't even in the movie that much! His name was just mentioned far more!\n- The camerawork felt super jarring. People thought TFA had too many close-up shots? In my three-four watches of TFA I never thought that, but in my single watch of Rogue One, I felt like I was getting motion sickness for almost half the movie.\n- Too many awkward callbacks. Like, not just slight nods. As in, lines of dialogue ripped straight from the OT, spoken in almost the exact same tone.\n- Michael Giacchino's score was not the best. He's absolutely brilliant and one of my favorites, but not only did the score feel mostly like a backdrop, but there were actual musical moments that felt...weird and jarring to me. EDIT: Probably not his fault either, since it was very much a rush job.\n- Some of the actors were ridiculously good. Some were just plain bad.\n\nIn the end, some really high highs, but super inconsistent with itself.",

The last act of the movie was full of desperation and death and that's exactly how it should've been.\n\nIt was honestly refreshing to see Mads Mikkelsen not play a badass of sorts. He nailed the father figure role and it was really good to see him and Ben Mendelsohn play off each other. One observation I had, I couldn't understand what accent Ben was trying. \n\nForest Whitaker delivers the hammiest performance of this movie but that's not really much of a complaint for me. \n\nThe action was on point.\n\nI don't think I've ever felt so bad for a droid since Terminator 2. \n\nThis is the Star Wars we need to see.

Final third of the movie was edge of the seat kinda stuff and emotional. Overall it was excellent as a stand alone and the Vader scenes were well placed.

We all know how this ends and who the heroes of that ending are, but most stories rarely talk about how the hero sits on the bodies of those who made that victory possible. This movie was for them and if you happen to read this before going see it I hope you keep this in mind. Overall I enjoyed it, 7.5/10. \n\nPS: CGI has come a looooooooonnngggg way. Props to them for getting Tarkin and Leia down to the follicles. \n\nPPS: Vader has never looked more badass than he did in the end with that sudden red glow in the darkness. For me this movie did a better job of that than the original trilogy did, from his 'Barad-Dur' like fortress to that James Earl Jones voiceover. \nPPPS: One thing I really appreciated was the firing of the laser and how sudden it was compared to Episode 4. If the intent was to inspire terror at the suddenness and lack of explosive sound to its impact, well done. ",

Rogue One needed better pacing to let you absorb the environment/storytelling. I thought it was an odd choice to kill off the *entire* cast, as there was no emotional weight to their deaths (except K2SO), plus everyone on the planet knows the story of A New Hope so the ending was really a foregone conclusion.](#spoiler) \n\n[The story was also needlessly confusing, jumping from one planet/character to another every 5 minutes (or less!). The violence, although very noisy, felt extremely sanitized - even the prequels had the balls to chop fools arms off.](#spoiler) \n\n[I will admit, however, that Rogue One is a gorgeous film and beautifully rendered. Vader was a proper badass, even more so than in the originals (IMO), and was actually intimidating. CGI Tarkin was extremely uncanny looking (his skin is just too smooth/glowing, and of course the eyes give him away instantly), which made his scenes really distracting, but CGI Leia was fairly impressive.](#spoiler)\n\nAlso it didn't have the Star Wars title crawl, which is Heresy!",

Perhaps even better than the Force Awakens, which had a magical first 45 minutes and then shifted into a more cliche predictable final two acts. (That's not to say I didn't like Force Awakens. Adam Driver was great and the final fight was cool).\n\nI felt like Rogue One had the opposite problem. I was somewhat unsatisfied by the first act; Jyn's backstory left something to be desired, and I found myself wishing for more about how she became the fighter she was (I WANT MORE FOREST WHITAKER DAMNIT) and why she was suddenly so willing to [go on a suicide mission on behalf of the rebellion](#spoiler). The movie ran two and a half hours long so I understand why they couldn't include everything, but I did think that the lack of character development hurt the emotional arc of the characters and story at certain moments. \n\nALL THAT BEING SAID, the final action sequence of Rogue One is maybe the best in the entire franchise. The space battle was thrilling, as was the fight on the planet below. Felicity Jones did a lot with not a lot to work with in terms of back story, and the dialogue had a lot of the necessary Star Wars-style humor that had the whole theater laughing. Any issues I had didn't leave a sour taste in my mouth. As a whole the film is a deserving part of the franchise and I'd happily see it again. Highly recommend you see this movie and you see it in theaters. ",

            "body": "Let me be divisive here. Great visuals mostly. Some wonky CGI, especially faces. Feels like a true original Star Wars film. But it felt largely inconsequential. I cared about nobody in the film. I felt no tangible emotional conflict. Beats were played as beats but lacked emotional punch. I was staring at a lot of pretty things but felt really detached. Dialogue was wooden and some lines were horribly flubbed. This felt like it was because the actors weren't directed properly to pick the right tone. A lot of fanservice. Many cheeky lines by the robot just for the sake of making an audience laugh. It's easy to see the droid as funny until you realize he's just copying the same thing that every story writer runs to to make robots funny - indifferent calculation in the face of danger. It's good to see two Asian major characters but they, like most to all major characters in this film, are reduced to overplayed tropes. Donnie Yen is blind martial arts master who is wise and has a brash friend with a big gun who learns how to be fearless from Donnie. That's their entire arc. No other thing interesting about them. Cool moments: Jyn and other male character arguing, Vader slashing. Weird moments: seeing Vader speak but James Earl Jones feeling like his lines have been recorded in an entire different atmosphere and totally not in flow with the conversation. Good to hear his voice again, but from a purely nostalgic point of view. I ask myself: if this wasn't Vader himself, would I be happy with his character? The answer is no. But I'm blinded by nostalgia so I thought including his scenes was a bonus.\n\nOverall atmosphere was dry and practical, but had an inkling too much bad CGI. Too referential also. Those who complain about Force Awakens borrowing too much from originals will probably not be so happy with Rogue One. Also the name drop of the title in this is hilariously forced. Many plot conflicts and their resolutions are at the same time both needlessly convoluted and achingly simple and dull. Never has creating a diversion to let someone climb up a chamber and grab a floppy disk been so overdramatized. The \"race against time\" theme is forced and unclimactic due to pacing concerns.\n\nSome good performances littered throughout but ultimately a waste of good actor talent. Gareth Edwards needs to work on getting actors to portray emotions of the characters and get to the core of them. He's a SFX director more than a drama director. And Star Wars will rise and fall on its drama rather than its SFX affectations, no matter what certain diehards may say. Judging Rogue One as a film first and not a Star Wars piece of memorabilia, it had promise but needs work to become excellent. Hopefully future Star Wars films can excel this and bring us films that engage more humanly, like Force Awakens did.\n\nThat's just my opinion and all are welcome to agree or disagree on any to all points.",

            "body": "So I just saw Rogue One (opens today in France) and let my thoughts on it merinate for a bit. I consider myself to be a fan of the movies, in the sense that I saw all of them, but never grew a passion for the franchise, I enjoyed the first trilogy a lot and the second not so much. I felt compelled to write this after I saw the movie. Here is what I thought of Rogue One:\n\nThe movie deals with heavy stuff, and I'd say it is considerably the first Stars Wars movie really for adults. If I had to sum up my thoughts on it in one sentence, I'd say it's amusing and often doll. Let me explain:\n\n1- Hero Characters: It's safe to say that those who saw A New Hope know how Rogue One will end. All I wanted Rogue One to do is invest as much as possible in our hero characters, make us understand their intentions and care about them. This was not achieved one bit, and surprisingly, the only character I was invested with was K-2SO, the droid. This is a huge problem for me, and I left wondering wether I would have enjoyed it more if I only saw the last 30 minutes or so of the movie (yes, that's how hallow most of characters felt to me).\n\n2- Script: Let me say this, Rogue One is a flawlessly exectued movie of a frustratingly flawed script. This is the first Star Wars movie that depicted really well the immensity of the Star Wars universe, and give those involved a lot of credit. However, the script seemed to be struggling with whether this should be a gritty war movie (which it was in the last 30 minutes or so) or a fun funny Star Wars movie, \u00e0 la Force Awakens. The first two acts of this movie served so little for me in making the last act as impactful as it should have been. Which brings me to my third issue:\n\n3- Dialog and pacing: I felt bored at times, and cringed at others. Part of the problem is that the mvie spent too much time establishing a lot of things that at the end served little purpose. The dialog felt at times forced and in the way. This is the first Star Wars movie with uncharacterstingly too many corny, long and  repetitive speechs, and the movie could have done without them.\n\n4- The bad guy: It seems like the Marvel plague of bad villains has reached Star Wars because Krennic was doll and very forgettable.\n\nNow to the good stuff, which in my opinion outwhighs the bad stuff:\n\n1- Vader was handled appropriatly, although I could have done with more of him, dude is just awesome!\n\n2- The battles are executed flawlessly, and the CG is the best I've seen in a Star Wars movie. \n\n3- You get your money's worth in the last 30 minutes. Great 3d act.\n\n4- Everything else I was happy with, and never felt out of place or devoid of purpose and meaning.\n\n5- The movie clearly gives the hardcore fans a lot to chew on, which I assume is great for them. I instead am sure I missed a lot of easter eggs.\n\nFinal Verdict: really fun movie, not as impactful as it aspired to be, with the first two acts serving little purpose, a 3d strong act and too many characters with little time invested in them. \n\nNote: 7/10. Would recommend.",

            "body": "Loved it.\n\nThat was on hell of a Star Wars fight at the end. Loved all the original sound effects, loved how well all of the original characters looked. I was into the moral ambiguity as well. To me, this was really the first time we got something like that from a Star Wars movie. Before this movie, everything in Star Wars is just good vs. evil. The closest thing you have to any gray character or faction is if they *used* to be evil and are now good. Han *used* to be a scoundrel, but now he's a hero. Anakin *was* a good guy, but then he was evil and then he became good again. The empire is evil because they're evil. The rebels are good because they fight the empire and they're evil. Here, it was different. The alliance is split up between extremist, pacifists, and someone who straight up puts a hit on the main characters dad--someone we're told from the start is a \"good guy\". It wasn't very Star Wars-y to have characters and organizations like that compared to the whole \"light side vs. dark side\" usual business, but it was neat! I thought it added a lot.\n\nLots of US occupation imagery early on. There's an evil empire occupying this middle eastern bazaar to harvest their natural resources. Local resistance groups ambush and bomb a military convoy. Cut to screaming Asian girl. It's different. You watch the movie and side with the good guys, but then think \"oh shoot when I watch the news, these are the bad guys!\" Episodes 1-6 never felt like they were making a statement about anything from the real world. The closest thing I can think of from episode 7 was the scene where they unveil Starkiller Base was *definitely* trying to evoke images of Nazis at the Nuremberg Rally. Some people might not like this. I get it. I think it's cool and interesting and that Star Wars would get boring if it didn't try stuff like this.\n\nI actually really liked the shield gate portal thing. Like there was a *reason* they couldn't all just warp in at light speed right to spot they needed to be on the planet. There was *reason* you'd have this big battle in space all over one spot. Then you have an Arial fight resembling WW2 dog fighting that's *visually* easy to understand and follow, but also one that makes sense.\n\nOn a related note, I liked how they silenced a lot of nit-picking too. Like people always want to bitch about this little stuff like \"Oh *why* did they design the death star to be so easily destroyed?\" Answer--it was designed that way on purpose by a rebel. Or \"Oh *why* can't they just transmit the death star plans to the rebel base?\" Answer--because the files are too big. Works for me!\n\nOne of my only gripes with this movie is that the Empire was never really *feared* outside of the very first scene and the very last scene (with Vader). This could all just be rose-tinted glasses, but in episodes 4 and 5, I really felt like the Rebels couldn't take the Empire head on. Sure, the main cast wouldn't have any problems with groups of storm troopers, but if the rebels straight up had a fight with the empire, they would get their assess kicked. On Leias ship, they get smoked. First death star fight, they all pretty much get smoked except Luke but he's special. In Empire, they run away. Heck, in Empire our heroes spend most of the movie getting stomped and captured by them. With the exception of two scenes, at no point in this movie did I ever feel like the Empire outmatched the rebels or the common man. I dunno. You can't just *tell* me that these people have lived through a lifetime of hell at the hands of the empire before the movie started. You can't just cut from a little girl seeing her mom die to flashing forward to years later where she's on a labor colony and expect me to fear the villains. I can't just be *told* this guy has been struggling since he was 6 years old. Maybe they felt like some of the things I'm suggesting would make it too much of a downer, and take away from the adventurous and swashbuckling tone that's key to Star Wars. Eh. They're probably right.\n\nOh--one more thing--people in my crew were knocking Vaders one liner about \"Choking on your ambitions\" saying that it was corny and Vader never acted like that in the original series. I'm like--guys--did you see the original series? Like all of the force chokes end with witticisms like that. \"I find you lack of faith disturbing\" and \"Apology accepted...\"\n\nGood stuff.",

The action scenes were phenomenal and it truly did capture to feeling of a war movie which I loved. And of course, the third act is just incredible and will go down as one of my favorite moments in the Star Wars universe. However, the movie has some big flaws as well. The biggest of which is the fact that most of these characters felt flat and were underdeveloped which made me have almost no investment in the actual plot which is honestly rather weak. The pacing while I don't think dragged like some people are saying felt honestly too frenetic and fast for it's own good and I felt like a few scenes felt a bit rushed. Also, the CGI Peter Cushing looked laughably bad anytime his face wasn't standing still. \n\nBut with that said, those last 45 minutes were absolutely perfect and everything that I wanted from this movie, especially the final 5 where it connects to A New Hope was done incredibly well. But it doesn't excuse the fact that a lot of the movie is just alright and I think that a lot of the people walking out saying it's great are just coming out and basing it off those last 45 minutes (which I can understand why) without taking the rest of the film into consideration.\n\nIt's still a good movie, but I was a bit letdown considering some of the hype I'd been hearing for the past couple of days.",

How bad ass was that when he was crushing fighters against the ceiling while deflecting blaster rounds like they were moths?

Garreth's just sense of scale and camera placement/movement just always felt so daunting and powerful.\n\nThe things that keep this at a 7.5-8 star film instead of a 9-10 star film though: it's lack of depth with the characters. We really only have two dynamic characters, and they make their conversion pretty early on in the film. There's no to time to wrestle or grow with them, and that's partially due to how quick the plot moves. I also felt that we didn't get a great connection to the team...all of those characters were mainly static and while they have great moments, they lack \"impact\" on the film in terms of their personalities and personal touch on the story. \n\nIn terms of the political dialogue: the movie is frustratingly close to being a very interesting critique on war/revolution/terrorism. The first half of the film hints at it so much, then it is dropped for the last two acts essentially after a quick discussion between our two leads. Again, this is mainly due to the construction of the plot, it never allows you to settle down and sit with these ideas. I would've loved a movie where we saw the rebels blowing up Imperial outposts, hurting innocents in the process, and a divide among those in the Rebellion about those kind of actions. \"We can't become like them to defeat them\" vs \"what is this cause we're fighting for? Is it worth it? Is this what we need to do to accomplish our goals?\" They had all the pieces in place to have this powerful political undertone, and again, they lose it to cram in that huge ending. While I love that last battle and it is epic to watch, I can't help but wish for a more contained story that would've allowed for more growth and interactions with my characters, and the political dialogues the movie so desperately was wanting to make.

The introductory shot of Jyn Erso in prison was as poor an introduction to this adult character. All we saw was a single image of where she was, before cutting away to ten places across the galaxy. Everything up until the sequence on Eadu desperately needed to be re-edited to form a cohesive narrative.\n\nThe characters as well weren't all that interesting. Cassian was a cypher of a hero, with nothing remarkable to add - his first sequence, where he kills the loud informant, was only impactful until he couldn't kill Garen, which took any and all logic away from that first scene. If he can kill an innocent but panicking rebel on his side, are we really to expect any less when he has the oppurtunity to kill a serious player in the Empire, with only a shred of doubt brought on by an evidence-free plea from a known criminal?\n\nBut that's a small complaint next to the entire portion of the film devoted to Saw Gerrera, who was over-acted by Forest Whittaker to a painful degree. His character looked impressive, but his wheezing and terrifyingly high-pitched groans only heightened his pointlessness. He was a filler character who existed only because the writers wanted to give a substantial role to Forest Whittaker. \n\nThere was good stuff in this movie, don't get me wrong. Chirrut the Blind Monk was a fun character, and Vader's brief sequence was amazing and awesome and everything one could want from a Darth Vader sequence, even if it felt tacked on after the (poorly charted) journeys of every significant character had already concluded. \n\nAre my cinema-going companions and I the only people who felt this way? It was a dull movie heightened by brief cameos and references, with a cool final act that sort of flops because the movie has already botched its chance to make us care about its heroes.",

I did love that in TFA but it loses its lustre a bit after repeated viewings. This was pure balls to the walls action all the way, and it felt darker and more grittier than TFA. And a tad more mature. Just a really really good movie for SW fans. The visuals were fantastic, and after getting over the initial shock of a resurrected Peeetah Cushing I kinda settled in on accepting the CGI on that character. *Not sure* about the ethics on that one though. Oh, and Vader.... Vaaaaader. I\u00b4m not so critical of Disney churning out \"SW-stories\" movies from now on if most of them turns out as good as this. I\u00b4m placing this on a temporary second best SW movie after Empire. Its fine with Rey and the Order, but now I really want more from this era.\n\n-So, can we get a stand-alone movie about how the grumpy guy with the fucked up nose that bumped into our leads got his ass out of that walled city before it went kaboom, and at some point later got himself to Mos Eisley only to grumpily bump into Ben and Luke there?

I love the idea of the story. The connective tissue to the original trilogy is fascinating. Explaining the exhaust port flaw, how Leias ship came to be pursued, etc. It all felt very natural.\n\nVadars scene was impressive and I got a battle chubby, I look forward to its youtube release so I can relive it. His other major scene felt... weird. I dont know what it was but his presence when talking to Mendelhsons character felt kinda forced (pun intended) and off putting, perhaps its his 1970s armor asthetic not fitting into modern day technology? I have no idea.\n\nThe end battle was bigger than anything ive ever seen in Star Wars, but it was a bit loud at times I felt. \n\nI loved killing off each of the characters, it had to be done and they all got their moment to shine.\n\nNow some of the not so good...\n\nTarkins uncanny valley. While I give them an A for effort, this CGI attempt didnt work at all for me. It looked so odd that I was down right distracted. They really didnt need to use Tarkin at all, use a made up character who is his underling or something. It was kinda the same thing with Leia at the end. I appreicate them trying, but it just didnt work for me.\n\nThe first 2/3 rds had some problems too, some of the pacing felt off and some of the interactions felt a bit stitched together.\n\nI know that sounds like a bitch fest, but its not, I enjoyed my experience overall, but that doesnt put a movie above criticism.\n\nIm super happy that there wont be a sequel and im glad Disney took the opportunity to test this movie concept.\n\nI would say the test was a success for sure.

I can understand her feeling the need to at least try, because hey it's what he wanted. But they killed her father. And she even said before that they had caused only pain in her life.\n\nSo why the fuck did she end up wanting to die for them? I think it was good to kill off most of the squad, it really drove home that they weren't unstoppable monsters like the other movies characters are, but I see little reason why Jyn died.\n\nAnyways, even with the problems I had, I still liked this movie a lot and it's one of my favorite Star Wars movies. Definitely better than TFA and I'm gonna recommend it to anyone who asks.",

Was really let down by how they killed of Saw Gerrera so early, especially after they made it a point of how he was a hardened extremist rebel to only just give up after just meeting Jyn, who I found uninteresting by the way. Some of Rogue One's deaths were underwhelming to me, specifically Donnie Yen's character, who I was hoping to go out with a bang. I did enjoy the final scene with Darth Vader, notably as he emerged from the shadow in the corridor. I really wanted to like this movie more. A solid 7.5/10 from something that had a big buildup but was a let down for me, not as good as The Force Awakens.",

The characters felt like they lacked motivation (for me), or at least a reason to have the motivations they have. Why didn't Cassian shoot Jyn's dad? Why did he suddenly start caring about people he met just a couple days ago? We saw him shoot someone who could give away information at the very beginning, although i suppose he saw no other choice to it when he did that. It just felt weird to set up his character like that, and then not do something with it. Also his fake death to save the day. I would have loved it if Jyn got shot on the walkway, instead of the bad guy monologuing, It would have thrown me off guard entirely, and would have fit in perfect with the other themes of the movie. Cassian could have been to late, but still manage to upload the data.\n\n\nIt also felt like it was very easy to see what was coming next, it felt like there was no surprise to what was going to happen. The only real surprise to me was killing all of the main cast, which i think was the right move, and a good idea. But since i didn't feel invested in the characters, i just didn't care. I mean, i can't think of a single real character trait to any of the characters. Cassian will do anything for the rebels. Chirrut is a force user. K-2SO is comedic relief. That's all i can think of. And i can barely remember their names.\n\nI do however think the action was excellent, and Vaders attack through the corridor was just perfect. Just the fact that you only hear is breathing, and all that goes through your mind is \"oh shit\"\nAnd then he slaughters everyone, and you just feel dread. And then you think \"oh, this one guys gonna get away!\" but he doesn't. And it was just so fantastic in every way.\n\nAnd that moment when the AT-AT's arrive on the beach fight. That was awesome.\n\nAnd the x-wings arriving. Goddamn. I've wanted to see proper combat with those for so long now. Space combat as well.\n\nI'm also not the world's biggest star wars fan, and i do think proper star wars fans are going to love this.\nI think i'll rewatch the movie someday, and i do think i'll like it a lot more then.  It's not a bad movie, at all. I just feel like the pacing, and characters aren't right for me, personally. its a 5-7/10 for me right now. But that will probably change over time. \n\n/edit I would love to hear others opinions on this as well! \n",

            "body": "I am baffled. I am completely stunned. \n\nThat was AMAZING. Absolutely brilliant. Far better, more adventurous and more daring then The Force Awakens. A film that truly deserves to stand next to Empire. Maybe its my lowered expectations speaking, but I was gob smacked by this movie. This movie, to me, represents all the possibilities that Star Wars now has thanks to the Disney acquisition. \n\nHere's what I was expecting; a cast of disposable, forgettable characters. Some cool action scenes. Some neat callbacks to A New Hope. A solid, competent, Marvel-esque film to sate the Star Wars hunger until Episode 8 arrives. \n\nWhat I got, however, was a dark, sinister, powerful film all revolving around one simple, powerful concept; creating hope, even in the darkest of times. Everything, from Chirrut's prayers to the Force to the utterly hopeless battles the Rebellion fights, from Saw's extremism in the name of dreams to the final line spoken; \"Hope.\" It gave the film power, depth, and ethos that I absolutely did not expect to be present. \n\nMaking me actually care about a cast of characters this big, only to brutally and senseless kill them all in the name of hope? Just ballsy as hell. Shocking, saddening, amazing. And actually turning a mirror on the Rebellion and showing some of the darker things they did adds a whole new layer of meaning and depth to the Star Wars canon. Reintroducing this grey morality in characters like Cassian or Saw is absolutely exciting to see.\n\nThe fact that this film contained the best Star Wars ground battle, the best Star Wars space battle, and the best Darth Vader scene of all time is just icing on the cake. This was jaw dropping cinematic spectacle all anchored by the core concept of creating hope. And that elevated this from a good film to a great film for me. \n\nI have some minor criticisms. The CGI recreations of Tarkin and Leia look great today, but they are going to seem extremely dated within a year. At times, the film telegraph's what is going to happen and which character is going to bite it next a little blatantly. There's one cameo that is just a little, LITTLE too much and took me out of the movie for a millisecond (Jyn running into the dickhead with the funny nose from ANH on Jedha. Are we really supposed to believe he was able to escape Jedha before it got blown to hell and made it to Tattooine within the week? Nitpicking, I know, but it was distracting).\n\nOn the whole though, this was magnificent. Immense character building, spectacular visuals, terrific context for A New Hope, a perfect blend of old school Star Wars charm and modern day film techniques, and an exciting portrait of what an original young filmmaker can do with this amazing cinematic sandbox. I would put it at the same level as Empire or A New Hope, honestly. 9/10 film for me. ",

The characters only seemed to serve the purpose of driving the plot rather than be fully fleshed out rebels with a backstory and the callbacks and cameos were too much for me. It just further proved that the scenes that most fans connected with were only for the sake of fan service and weren't an original creation of this particular film.\n\nMy main gripe with this movie was the tone; I couldn't connect with the characters' deaths because the music and the pace didn't indicate that we should care about these characters dying, the movie just killed each one and moved to the next death. This movie reminded me of Halo Reach a lot and I ended up comparing the two while watching this, only Reach made you empathise with each character's death because it happened over the course of the entire story rather than just a montage in the third act.\n\nThe final scene with Vader however was fantastic even if it doesn't really make sense to have one of the last remaining force users take out a bunch of troops, however I'll give it the benefit of the doubt because it was one of the fan service moments I actually enjoyed; it was the first time I ever felt as if Vader's presence in a scene induced a terrifying dread, and it made me freak out to imagine if I were in that same situation there would be no chance of survival.\n\nWhile I don't hate the film, I was a little disappointed with it in the end and probably won't bother watching it again. It didn't exceed The Force Awakens for me personally and Gareth Edwards as a director still has yet to impress me.\n\nSolid 7/10",

I didn't really connect with many of the characters - if anything I found them and their rousing speeches to be too archetypal and transparent.  The third act certainly gave it a shot in the arm and left me with a buzz on my way out, but it's hard to forget the opening 80 minutes.\n\n* I really like Felicity Jones as an actress, but I just didn't care much about her character, at all.  When she reacted to the [hologram message from her father I thought](#spoiler) \"wow, what a performance\", and then it fell flat for me again.\n\n* I thought most of K-2's lines were forced.  Like a 90s TV show about an edgy kid who has an earing and chews gum in church because he's edgy.\n\n* Minor point - the Vader stuff at the end was awesome, but felt weird for his character at that point.  We're used to seeing Vader in the comics and prequels doing cool force battle stuff, he didn't do much of that in the original trilogy and it seemed out of place for me.  Doesn't mean it wasn't awesome.  Vader going HAM.\n\n* I thought Ben Mendelsohn was fantastic as Krennic, but was a little disappointed at his ending.  Vader makes a point of telling him not to be too too ambitious, and he complies and basically becomes a whipping boy for the rest of the film.  Also, c'mon, like you couldn't have figured out who Jyn was.\n\n* That said, I think I may have missed a trick with that.  Was Jyn's declaration of who she was supposed to mean something?  We heard earlier that she was going by different names now, was this declaration supposed to signal her acceptance of her fate/her family's mission?  If so, that could have been handled better perhaps.\n\n* Finishing on a high note, the Scarif scenes were absolutely fantastic, and reminded me of the earlier Battlefront games.  I like that they went all out on the Dunkirk-angle, killing fools left and right.  It grabbed my attention and didn't let go till that [terrible Leia appearance](#spoiler).\n\nAll in all, when they announced this movie I had mixed feelings; (hooray Star Wars/why do I need to see a movie about this?) having watched the film now I still have mixed feelings.  There was no real need for it.  I would have preferred a spin-off about that Wampa from Empire, what motivations did he have for hanging Luke upside down, what happened to him after he lost his arm, did he continue Wampa-ing? ",

Of course it wasn't going to be on par with the original trilogy or The Force Awakens, which are incredible movies, it was still good nevertheless. I'd give it about a seven and a half. ",

Holy crap.\n\n-Vader' star destroyer physically blocking the escape of some ships was a great original concept (like coming out of hyperspace in orbit from Episode 7)\n\n-I'm surprised they followed through on killing everybody, although I do wish Vader would have been able to wreck a few of them. Like if the staff guy (sorry, I didn't pick up many names) ended up charging him as another force sensitive only to be absolutely manhandled in his sacrifice would've been a little more emotional to me.\n\n-No opening crawl and the in-progress title screen felt very out of place to me.\n\nOverall, a great visual Star Wars film with some of the most gripping, gritty action in the series.

            "body": "**What I loved:**\n\n-Cinematography was beautiful, as expected. Best I've seen in any Star Wars film besides ESB probably. The overhead shots of the planets in particular caught my eye.\n\n-Ben Mendelsohn stole the show in every scene he was in. Of all the characters in this film I wish I could see more of it's Krennic, but of course, he dead.\n\n-Vader. I don't need to repeat what everyone else in this thread has said. He fucked shit up. It was awesome.\n\n-Really glad Jyn and Cassian didn't turn into love interests.\n\n-The choreography for the action sequences, particularly for Donnie Yen's scenes, was perfect. Star Wars films pretty much never let down this one aspect.\n\n-It was great to see a movie with a Death Star in it where the Death Star does not explode for once (even though they got the plans to make it explode)\n\n**What I didn't love:**\n\n-The pacing in the first third of the movie was awful. I'm so glad it picked up or else I thought I was going to be in for a long, poorly edited ride. Like how many different planets are we going to visit in the first 20 minutes? Slow it down! It almost felt like the first third of the film and the rest of the film were edited by two different people/groups of people, and I wonder if the massive reshoots could also have anything to do with it.\n\n-Characters were mostly introduced very poorly. Like, why is Jyn in an imperial prison? I think it was mentioned briefly, but that seems pretty important, not something to gloss over and then quickly jump to the next scene. Goes back to the pacing issues. We just don't get to know any of these characters very well.\n\n-Along those same lines, off the top of my head right now, I could name 3 or 4 newly introduced characters from the film--Jyn, Cassio, Krennic, and K-2SO. Without looking, I couldn't name anyone else. Oh wait, I just looked, it's Cassian, Cassio is the name of a piano. Other characters are fun but we don't connect with them enough for them to be memorable. Like Donnie Yen's character is super cool but it's going to take me several tries to remember... uh... [checks]... *Chirrut \u00cemwe*, yeah that one.\n\n-Some of the CGI felt a little too, I don't know... video game-like, to me? Tarkin felt odd every time he was on screen. Total uncanny valley thing going on. Leia was too brief for me to really notice, but Tarkin had lots of screentime so it was just a little weird. And there was the scene where the Rebel ship crashes into the Star Destroyer above Scarif that looked a little below Lucasfilm's standards for CGI. Maybe I'm getting a little picky here. I'm a real sucker for practical effects, so CGI has to be used in just the \"right way\" or I tend to not like it.\n\n-These new Star Wars movies need to cool it with all the OT references. Like, they're funny in the theater watching for the first time but on rewatches I'm 100% I'm going to be like, \"why did they put this in here? It serves no purpose to the plot\". There were too many in Ep.7 and I was surprised by the number in this one as well. Really hoping it's not the case for Ep.8.\n\n**Overall Rating: 6/10** (7/10 if I wasn't including the weird first 30 minutes)",

Would have made that moment so much stronger\n\n* Donnie Chen as Chirrut \u00cemwe was a great character. \"Are you kidding me? I'm blind\" might be the best line in the movie.\n\n* The space battle scenes were some of the best in Star Wars. Love the ramming despite it seeming to be highly unrealistic. Then again I guess all star battles are highly unrealistic so who cares :)\n\n* Replacement Akbar was great\n\n*  Mads Mikkelsen is great in everything, just wish there were more of him in the movie\n\n* The plot point of Mads planting a vulnerability in the death star was pretty good for retconning the death star blowing up so easily.\n\n* Vader likes Turkish sauna\n\n* Everyone dies, I like it\n\nCons\n--\n\n* I didn't care about them dying\n\n* Pacing and plot in general is pretty bad. They fail to build up tension and rush through some great moments. Wannabe gritty war movie never quite felt gritty.  If they'd managed to make this movie feel dark and bleak it would have been awesome. All the ingredients are there but they're covered in a sugary coat of mainstream Star Wars.\n\n* Jyn was somewhat flat and unlikeable. \n\n* The movie felt small... they could have done a better job of conveying the vastness of space,the empire, and what was at stake.\n\n* K2SO felt like a bit of a Droid Sue, but I forgive him.\n\n* Stormtroopers still skipping target practice. Why not just replace them with imperial droids? They seem pretty good. \n\n* The only Swedish actor portrayed as a whining rebel. Have you learnt nothing Fares Fares? Sadla \u00e4lgarna!\n\n* Mad's death seemed clich\u00e9\n\n* I'd rather see Vader slaughtering real characters than replaceable rebel minions \n\n* I thought Jyn had samurai batons on her back and was about to go to town, disappointed.\n\n* Firing the death star twice seemed to take the punch of the second time they did it. I would only do it in the end and build it up more. In the movie, it feels like they're casually shooting womp rats in their T-16 instead of firing the most powerful weapon in the universe for the first time.\n\n* Why did they blow up their data center anyways, seems a bit excessive, did they have backups?\n\n* I really didn't care about Cassian at all, he could easily have been removed from the movie and made for a stronger Jyn.\n\n*  I'd like to see more reasoning behind the motivations of the empire and Krennic, instead they mostly come off as flat villains.\n\n* Vader needs a new interior decorator, he got the dramatic lighting down pat though. \"Hey, Empiral Lighting Fixtures? Yeah, I want this massive light back here so I can stand in front of this door, it'll slowly slide up and cast a massive shadow in front of anyone that want's to see me. I'll show them my dark side Muhahahaha!\"\n\n* Too many characters we don't care about, I know it's supposed to be more of an assemble but either build them up properly or concentrate on a few characters.\n\n* The \"Choke on your aspirations\" felt a little over the top and jokey for Vader\n\n* I'd like to see more character building of Jyn and her father. Why not show some scenes from him \"inside the empire\" rather than just tell us about it? Would have made for a cool subplot. Tack on some scene in the beginning with character building between the whole family so we care that they die\n\n* Saw Gerrera seemed superfluous\n\n* The mindbending tentacles I could have lived without. Tired of the constant pandering to the Japanese audience.\n\n* So much uncanny valley, either they should have done Tarkin/Leia better or dropped those scenes or not show their faces. I've could have done without gold leader etc as well\n\n* Some of the easter eggs felt tacked on and could have been more subtle (the Mos cantina guy, I'd rather just glimpse r2d2 etc/c3p30 in the background, or just omit them)\n\n* I like that they die in the blast in the end... but they didn't set it up. Why not have them try to desperately find a shuttle first? They just gave up.",

The story jumped around to move it along, but honestly I didn't feel like their was any reasoning that they went where they did. They went to one place and then bam they went to another. \n\nOverall it was fun, some very sweet scenes in it, darth vadar at the end was amazing. I liked that they had the jedi temple guardians as thats not something I believe we've seen before but those guys are important to the universe. \n\nOne question I left with was. They said they knew a jedi woman who was part of the clone wars that could help them. But they never talked about it again. The only one I could think of was Asoka, which would be fcking incredible to see as she is an amazing character!!\n\n\nMy gripes with this movie. Again, we see a storyline centered around the deathstar. Yes I know this was kind of a prequel thing. But the star wars universe is HUGE and their are so many interesting characters and planets and history. I really could care less about this story at all. I turned off immediately basically when I saw early on it was about the deathstar. I get it was a huge moment and its such a unique story/movie item, iconic. But they need to stop this. Force awakens was about the deathstar (2) and some of the first movies and now this one. \n\nI was hoping this was going to be a singular story or a 2 part story in line with what the clone wars did. The clone wars was amazing because it touched on this part of the story that was huge battles, and military action in the universe. The jedi's were out in force on missions and leading squadrans and stuff. I'm not saying jedi NEEDED to be there, there was a lot of cool soldiers and the red team squadran etc. etc. that could all have amazing stories. \n\nFrom a quality standpoint, I thought the 3d was awful in this one. The picture seemed extremely blurry in some scenes like the depth wasn't setup right. In others it came through very clear.\n\nI thought the cinematography was hit and miss. In force awakens you have some amazing scenes showing scale and distance and stuff and it just didn't come across in this movie. For example, in force awakens they skim along the desert to a downed imperial capital ship (or whatever they are called). Then they show you a person inside and the scale of it is made clear. In this one they have the same ship overtop of Jetta and its like.. so.. meh.. how big is that? Those ships are imposing things!!! It should be reflected. Instead it came across almost weak.\n\nThere was a lighting scene that really bothered me. The ships start coming out of the darkness with the deathstar in the background. Somehow the ships got lit up slowly, but the deathstar was still all in black. Then when the deathstar started to get lit, the ships at the same point, were dark!!! Fix your fcking lighting.\n\nThe cg characters were done fairly poorly I felt in this one. They seemed much better in force awakens, or hell even Jar Jar felt better and more realistic then some of the cg characters (i know i know).\n\nNo reason NOT to go see it, I think it was a good movie, but I think if you confine to a star wars movie, it was super weak, and they missed an opportunity.",

If that CGI had been in a game or a fully CGI film it'd be second to nothing.

I appreciate what they did, but it was hard not notice it.   Once again, full props to the animation department for pulling that off as best as I have ever seen it done, but most the scenes that showcased Tarkin (and the one Leia scene) were in very well lit, and in very sharp focus on the character.   If things like lower lighting, and use of wider shots were used for the Peter Cushing scenes I think the effect would have been much better.  ",

Although I also got chills when Vader had his moment at the end, but the bitter-sweet feeling has really stuck to me.\n\nI would say in my opinion that this is the best Star Wars movie since Empire.\n\nThat said it wasn't a flawless movie. I found the first act to be a bit on the plodding side but once we got to the first Rebel attack I felt the movie hit the right pacing. Also I felt Darth Vader's suit looked really cheap and the actor didn't quite move right.\n\nAlso very minor complaint that can't really be held against the film because it my own personal prefrence and probably wouldn't have worked with how this movie sart anyway... I would have still prefered to have an opening crawl.\n\nBut this film took Star Wars in a different direction successfully and has opened up the franchise for wider possibilities in the future.",

They let us sneak in to another showing already in progress to re-watch the last hour, this time without talking dipshits.  Also gave out free passes to come back again any time in the next 3 months.  Very well handled.  \n  \nI was a little underwhelmed by the film, but at the same time found a lot of things I liked.  K2-S0 was awesome.  Pushing a disabled star destroyer into another star destroyer was great.  The Vader scene gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.  \n  \nI liked the poetic-ness of Krennic being killed by his own weapon.  \n  \nThe cinematography was, I thought, great.  So many beautiful landscapes.  \n\nCGI was really good.  Except for Tarkin and Leia.  They probably should have either not included them, or, at the most, had them interact via hologram.  Only way that tech works is having the original actors/actresses play the part and CGI over them like they did with Douglas in Ant-man, and RDJ in Civil War.  \n  \nFew too many plot devices in the third act.  Get to the dish, it's the only way to transmit!  Align the dish!  But we have to get the shields down!  And we have to throw this lever to get the radios to work!  Felt like our heroes were playing an MMORPG there for a while.\n\nOverall I liked it.  It wasn't amazing.  Definitely wasn't bad.  Solid movie.  Made me laugh a few times.   Made me nostalgic a few times.  Hit me in the feels when everybody started dying (especially K2).  \n  \nReally wish I hadn't seen the second trailer that told us that Mads was her dad and was an imperial weapons designer.  From that second I knew he'd be the one who intentionally made a flaw in the Death Star.  Oh well.",

The characters except for Jynn, Cassiun, and Krennic seemed a little one-dimentional, but they were supporting character so I do give them a pass.\n\nKTSO is cool as hell and Donnie Yen's character was also a stand out.\n\nThe action is done better than any SW movie to date, the space battle ranks right up there with the ROTJ space battle and in many ways felt like it.\n\nVader isn't in the film a lot, don't go see it just for him. But he does get 2 major scenes, both of which are handled very, very well.\n\nAnd the last 60 seconds of this movie are, to me, the best 60 seconds of Star Wars ever. It is incredible and left me with the feeling of wanting to immediately watch A New Hope.\n\nThere is a use of facial-reconstruction CGI, and while it is noticeable once or twice, I think for the most part really pays off and is a massive technical achievement for how heavily it is relied upon.\n\nCameos for the most part are handled well.\n\nAnd to compare it to another Star Wars movie, I felt like the way they cram everyone into place in Revenge of the Sith felt really rushed while in this film virtually all of it felt natural.\n\nDislikes:\n\nThe score wasn't too memorable. The only moments that got me excited in relation to the music were the re-workings of John Williams's pieces.\n\nThere was some dialogue that felt out of place at times, especially with a major character in the Star Wars universe that just didn't fit their personality.\n\nThere's one cameo that seemed like really forced (hah!) fan-service.\n\nIt does drag slightly at times.\n\nI didn't love Forest Whitaker in this movie, which is weird because he's usually great in everything. I didn't feel he brought much acting-wise to the table though.\n\nIf I had to score it a la Rotten Tomatoes I'd give it an 87%\n\nEDIT: Oh! And first Star Wars movie without any real inklings of a love story, which I thought was pretty rad.\n\nEDIT 2: Shit, the title screen... just God awful.",

Is that just me or did anyone else notice that?\n\n4) some of the space fighting scenes towards the end kinda reminded me of the original trilogy which was bothersome to me. Looked like a video game and not real looking like episode 7\n\n5) it seemed like Forest Whitaker was wasted on that part really quick and died in the most pointless way possible. Why not keep him and have Vader kill him. Do something. Don't show similarities between his character and Vader (the breathing and black armor) and then not pay it off by showing Vader kill off a copy cat (yes I know he probably came first). \n\nOver all I thought the movie was good.

Expository dialogue was repeated throughout, bombarding the audience again and again with the specific stakes of needing the shield down and to transmit the files.\n\nThe most frustrating part of the climax was the treatment of Donnie Yen.

I liked The Force Awakens as a kind of soft reboot/apology for the prequels, but I want them to take more risks with 8 and 9. I've never really delved in to the EU. \n\nThat's all just to give you some context about my relationship with Star Wars, as I think everyone brings their own baggage in to it.\n\nSo with all that said, I really didn't like this film at all. I walked out of it feeling off towards it, and the more I think about it, the more negatively I feel.\n\nCharacters: I didn't care about any of the characters. They just show up, are given no real depth or motivation, and then die. They had about 10 lines each, I swear. Tom Hardy had more lines in Fury Road than these guys did. A good death scene in a film always gets me. There have been death scenes in films I don't even like that have given me an emotional reaction, but I felt nothing for any of these guys. I think the biggest problem is none of them had any real presence or charisma. I know all of these guys can act, I've seen them do it in other films, but their performances here just felt off. Funnily enough, it's directed by Gareth Edwards. All the human performances felt off in Godzilla as well. I feel like the guy just can't direct actors very well.\n\nVader: The scene of him wrecking shit at the end was legit. Loved that. But his first scene was so off. Darth Vader has a house? I guess logically that makes sense, but I really didn't need to see it. His voice was off in the scene. I would suggest its due to James Earl Jones getting older, but he sounded fine in Rebels recently. His dialog was awful, and the pun at the end was even worse. Also was his armour a different design? It just didn't look right.\n\nThe pacing: It felt simultaneously boring, and yet way too quick. Guardians of the Galaxy is obviously a very different film in tone, but I'm going to use it as a comparison because they essentially have to set up the same things. Cast of diverse characters, complicated universe, and planet destroying stakes. They even have a similar third act, in that the main characters try and accomplish a mission with the help of a larger team (Rebel Alliance, Nova Corp.) Guardians is 11 minutes shorter than Rogue One, and yet by the end of that film I knew every character so well. I felt like they'd all be developed, had interacted, and had all formed unique bonds. Every character got to play with every other character in some way. Even side characters like Nebula or Yondu felt like they were better developed than anyone in Rogue One, and they did it with less screen time.\n\nForest Whitaker: What. The. Fuck. Was. That!? Seriously, what the actual fuck? Terrible character, terrible performance, and just no need for him. You could completely remove that character from the film and so little would change. The idea is cool on paper. A militant extremist who breaks away from the Rebellion for being too soft. Fuck yeah, I can roll with that. The execution, however, was perhaps the worst thing I have seen on screen this year. He sounded like he was about to burst in to tears in every scene, spoke a bunch of gibberish that rarely added up to anything, raped a dude with his hentai tentacle lie detector monster, and then died because he literally just gave up. He still seems to be very active and running some kind of resistance, but then some shit blows up and he's just like \"nah I'm cool with dying, you guys go. I'm going to chill here.\"\n\nMusic: Just felt off. I know they didn't want to use the Star Wars music due to the different tone this film is striking, but they kept sort of flirting with it. Most of it sounded like a poor rip off, where someones tried and failed to recreate the John Williams score in their bedroom using a computer program. Either use it properly, or do something completely different. \n\nThe plot: So many things happened simply because the plot needed them to happen. The rebels knowing where to find Jyn even though she's imprisoned under a different name. Randomly bumping in to the blind dude and his friend. The pilot being attacked by that monster that drives people mad, but then just randomly snapping out of it. The Death Star firing away from the base, just so they could have time to have an emotional scene before the blast destroyed them.\n\nThe villain: Rubbish. He spends the entire film just getting bitch slapped around by Vader and Tarkin. His own team don't even take him seriously, so why should we? I'm pretty sure you could remove 90% of his scenes from this film, and it doesn't impact anything. The only thing he effects is kidnapping her father at the start. Everything else in the entire film would have happened regardless of his involvement. \n\nSo, as I'm sure you can tell, I'm not a fan. I honestly can't understand all the praise the film is getting. I genuinely think this is a poorly made film, by a director out his depth. \n\n\n\n",

            "body": "I just got back from a screening in the UK, if you're interested in reading the thoughts of a 31yo fan of the OT/hater of the PT/someone who now likes TFA despite initially finding its reliance on nostalgia to be disappointing (phew) see below:\n\n\nPROS:\n\n-The art direction and aesthetic was absolutely spot on. I wouldn't say this has been a problem in any of the Star Wars movies though, including the terrible prequels. The general visual design of the new ships and robots etc gelled pretty well with the OT designs.\n\n-The general idea/basic plot was good, worthwhile, and I'd argue that most of the connective tissue to the OT was stronger and more relevant than anything in the prequels. I'd much prefer to see movies like this as opposed to spin-offs with younger/older versions of main characters from the OT.\n\n-A lot of the cinematography was great, very cinematic and quite unique in the Star Wars pantheon.\n\n-With the exception of the digital actors, the special effects were great.\n\n-Vader's second appearance was excellent, easily the highlight of the film.\n\n-KS20 was pretty great, bar one or two lines that missed the mark.\n\n-Soft-retconning of the Death Star exhaust port design fault was a nice touch.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-The biggest issue with this movie, for me, was the dialogue. Most of it was boring, and much else was clunky exposition, unfunny, or at times even cringeworthy. As such I didn't identify with the characters particularly and so didn't care for what was happening to them, which was a big problem for me, especially come the climax.\n\n-Continuing from the above, the characters didn't feel fully fleshed out, there were probably too many of them and none of them really had any 'arcs' as such. Stuff just happened to them.\n\n-The acting was a bit wooden at times. Again I feel this is more a fault with the writing and less a criticism of any of the actor's abilities.\n\n-As many others have said, the first act flitting between characters/planets was messy and the pacing suffered.\n\n-Vader's first appearance was laughably bad, the costume/setting and frankly embarrassing dialogue evoked prequel levels of cringe in me.\n\n-The reliance on one particular CGI character was, in my opinion, unnecessary and misjudged. Another digital actor appearing later was at least only on screen for a few seconds. Honestly, both attempts were good efforts, but it's clear the technology isn't there (they both looked like cartoons). The uncanny valley is very real, they could've included these characters in more subtle ways with less obvious camera angles and more efficient writing.\n\n-Some of the call backs to ANH were quite gratuitous IMO.\n\n-Admiral RADISH?! Did I hear that correctly? I think they called somebody ADMIRAL RADISH?!\n\n-I love some of Michael Giaccino's scores, but initial impressions of his work on this movie are not good.\n\n\nI could nit pick this movie to death but the long and short of it is I found it quite boring and generally didn't really care about anything that was happening.",

Nothing against Daisey Ridley, who I think has all the makings of a fine actress, but Felicity Jones is more experienced and it shows. *TFA* had great action sequences but these are arguably done even better. Certainly the battle itself is more epic. At the end I had the immediate urge to watch *ANH*. I hope a nearby theater hits on the idea of doing a double billing soon.\n",

To be honest, the finale was really good. Like, ***really good*** the whole beach scene was great. But my god, everything leading up to it was just... not good. Pacing is all over the place, names, characters, places thrown at your face at breakneck speed then the movie slows down for no reason at all. I think Vader is only for like 3 minutes or 5 tops, and he's the best of the movie. Also, I think this is probably the worst Star Wars score I've heard. Episode VII was underwhelming but had some great tracks, like Rey's theme. This one was pretty meh.\n\nAll in all, I think the beach scene makes you forget how average the movie is. If we had to divide it in parts, 3/4 are mediocre, but the last act is awesome. A 7/10 sounds about right. It's probably my least favorite out of the non-prequel movies. **Edit** *ah, downvotes although I gave it an okay review. Gotta love this subreddit*",

Voice could've been a little close to OG Tarkin too IMO. Leia's CGI however was fantastic. \n\n-Vader's appearance with the Rebels was intense. Shame he couldn't pull those moves on Obi-Wan in ANH. His base on Mustafar* amazing. Maybe we might see it again in a future film. The voice was quite off too which was a shame but I suppose it comes down to age. \n\n-Was great to see Yavin IV again including Bail Organa and that hint at getting Obi-Wan back in the game. Great to see prequel elements making their way in. \n\n-I found it incredibly difficult to care about most of these people dying considering we know so little about who they are or their backstories. Especially the pilot. Krennic was also underutilised which was a shame.\n\n-For all the times they were mentioned, I wish the Kyber crystals were utilised more throughout the film. Cool to see them finally mentioned in a film though. \n\nEDIT: *",

Real stakes and consequences. Hell yes. While TFA was good and made just to rinse the bad taste of the prequels out of our mouth, this movie shows that you can be Star Wars and compelling. It's a kin to why the KOTOR games are amazing or the Star Wars 1313 concept kicked ass. \n\nTwo lingering things remain though. CGI de-aging still looks fucking terrible and off putting. Secondly why, why even add that? Is there a sane competent adult that doesn't know how this connects to the original movie? I feel like that was really put in by the studio. \n\nOverall a good movie that refills me with love of Star Wars. Will not call it great until Disney brings Thrawn into canon or has an Episode without another fucking Death Star. \n\n#Edit: Thanks for introducing me to Clone Wars/Rebels and proving Thrawn is back. Seriously this show is fucking awesome. I binged watched all the seasons in a pillow fort with my dog, a plate of French bread pizza and Jolt Cola. Star Wars Rogue One has been upgraydedd from good to great. ",

It did very little to be engaging because it was in such a rush to introduce everyone that it gave little to no time for me to even remember a lot of their names. The movie really seemed to find its footing when they all went to find Jynn's dad. Obviously Darth Vader was great in every second he had and the glow of his lightsaber in the dark may just give me nightmares when I go to sleep tonight, and I oddly enjoy that since it shows Vader as a symbol of terror instead of just a villain in this movie. Overall, I wish this movie had a little more time put into editing so it could have been less choppy in the first act. I wanted this movie to really grip me from the beginning and that just wasn't the case. A solid 8/10.\n\nP.S. how about the CGI for young Carrie Fisher?",

Well.... \n\nBut I like that, it makes sense. Where would they have gone? Why didn't they show up again? \n\nI think they aimed very high and hoped to have a really cool amount of characters in it but so many of them were pointless and thus not remembered. Did Forrest Whittaker REALLY have to be in it? His rag tag band of rebel rebels didn't make any true difference. It could easily have just been that Jyn had been rescued by another character and that whole plot could be dropped. Why was she in jail? The movie just tried to do a lot in a short space of time. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed it, you still get the \"fuck yeah!\" feeling when the rebels do something good, I liked that the rebels were unsure how to proceed and unwilling to risk it all for nothing. I liked that some decided to proceed regardless. Each lost rebel actually struck home on the final mission as they sold their lives for small gains. The jedi not jedi was quite tense despite it being an obvious success and I came out thinking that the force is quite fickle. Once you have achieved your destiny(??) the force leaves you to it.  \n\nUltimately it does an amazing job of joining episode 3 and 4 together by answering a lot of questions - my main one being why the hell did the rebels have so few ships? Well they had plenty but they risked them all to get the Death Star plans. The exhaust port, a long slated plot hole, takes centre stage which is amazing!\n\nHowever, why the fuck was Princess Leia on the battlefield? Given that the rebels had lost at that point and that ship was toast, I do wonder why Leia hadn't bailed. \n\nPlus the \"we're on a diplomatic mission\" now doesn't make much sense given that Darth Vader watched that corvette jump to hyperspace.\n\nA lot of rambling but you'll have to forgive me, the film did a lot of it too.\n\nOne final moan - they introduced a SHITLOAD of new starfighters - that is all going to be with the intention of flogging a lot more X-wing Miniature ships for the FFG game.

Plenty of \"Hell yeah!\" moments, and the emotions were much more raw and real feeling. Redeemed the slowness of the first half and then some.\n\nI was weirdly affected by the CGI Peter Cushing. He was one of my favorite actors (no Halloween is complete without a Horror of Dracula and Curse of Frankenstein double feature), and seeing his digital doppelganger onscreen kinda hit me in the gut. Effects weren't \"flawless\", but still damn good, and I wouldn't mind seeing more classic actors resurrected in this manner (with their families properly compensated, of course).\n\nVader was badass, but his voice was a little...unVadery? Not terrible, but I've heard amateurs online do digitally altered Vader voices that sounded more like Vader.\n\nFun movie, would watch again, 7/10.",

Once I got over the initial magical re-birth, The Force Awakens has for me turned into almost a total turkey. I sense this won't happen with Rogue 1.\n\nThe stuff I didn't like is probably more interesting than the stuff I did (Vader[wow, just wow]; Iamonewiththeforcetheforceiswithme [awesome]; The varied X-Wing assaults; the idea of an extremist rebel faction; the shield gate; K2-SO screwdriver-ing another K2; Shoretroopers!!!). \n\nKudos too for some of the cinematography; especially loved how they managed to 'look down' on Scarif from the space battle above; I found that really kept the perspective. Compare it to the chaos of the ROTJ space battles and the prequels. \n\n-- My only -major- beef was with the climactic task facing Jen and Cassian. They basically have to send an email with a big attachment. Eugh. And then they have to manually operate a robotic 'file grabber' to get at it. Eugh. And then the 'antenna re-alignmnet' ... tbf, actually they pulled it off, more-or-less, but I just thought that was all a bit ... well that they could have come up with something equally perilous but a bit less ... Roger Moore?\n\n-- Do I detect some dissatisfaction with the Tarkin / Leia CGI? I thought they were both amazing. It's been a while since I have been actually blown away by a visual/special effect in a movie - Tarkin especially made me gasp with incredulity at first. Top drawer work.\n\n-- The score was a bit off-putting; sort of weirdly not quite proper Star Wars. Make up a brand new them OR stick to the old one: pick one. This was a bit of hybrid and it was slightly distracting.\n\n-- Weird that they called one of the places Jedah (ok not *Jeddah*); I mean if you are making up names for planets and such that you are going to destroy with a WMD then why not just steer clear of ones that sound like major Islamic cities?\n\n-- The entire cast was fine but I didn't properly 'buy' Diego Luna in that pivotal role. No menace in him and I felt he should have been beefier, more gnarly and older. If you absolutely needed a Latino sort-of guy here then Pedro Pascal would have been awesome in this role. A father-daughter play with Jen may have been more interesting then the sort-of non-romance they made an effort at. But I am nit picking.\n\n-- Not enough AT-ST action for me\n\n-- Some of the ships over Jeddah seemed like their perspective was not quite right\n\n-- Not enough Mendelsohn by far\n\n-- How was Galen actually killed? The suggestion was collateral damage from an explosion caused by an X-Wing?\n\nOverall, absolutely loved it as a cinematic experience.",

So when does Leia connect with R2 before being boarded and captured by Vader? Surely if she went back to base to meet with him the plans would already be secured?\n\nEdit: Alright, so I just threw on ANH and sure enough, the opening text confirms she's on her way home from the battle, being pursued by the Empire at the start of the movie and the ship is the same one we see her escape in during the final moments of Rogue One... SO... was it a mistake showing R2D2 and C3P0 annoyed at being left behind at the rebel base?? Didn't R2 and C3P0 meet on Luke's planet after R2 escaped with the plans???

The film looks good but the dim 3D (no 2D here) in the theater made me angry, not to mention that there's little depth or 3D separation, I'm a film guy and I gotta say that I don't think digital really suits Star Wars, didn't think so with AOTC & ROTS (even though that was the very beginning of digital cinematography).\n\nEspecially surprising that it's taking place before ANH, so shooting digitally just seems like a boneheaded move to me, but hey, the DP felt it was right, and Gareth is used to it, it looks good, but yeah, TFA & 35mm win. \n\nThe third act is as excellent as everyone says it is. Giacchino's score is solid, even though several themes are just reused, but for something he composed in 2 months, it's impressive.\n\nNOW, the CG Tarkin, god, so distracting, why? Like someone said, I bet the studio pushed it. It's not that it looks BAD, it looks very good for what it is, but it is just so damn not real, it's just not there, it doesn't work. Actually, ya know what? It did work when they only showed him his back turned to us, profile or 3/4, there it worked, but I could not believe that they showed him in 3 separate scenes in a close-up or medium. You could tell that somehow, either the VFX guys were really proud of it and they wanted to show it, or the studio pushed for it.\n\nI don't understand why they couldn't keep it to certain angles and AVOID a close-up where you can just see that the motion is wrong, that it doesn't work. Leia was the same for the very last shot, show her profile and that's it ! \n\nAlso, although I wish there was more Vader, I have to admit they used him the right way, that last scene was nice candy although super short.\n",

Why did Anakin Skywalker turn to the Dark Side? What actually were the Clone Wars? etc.) So *Rogue One* has an especial need to tell an engaging story with interesting characters, and to build on *A New Hope* in such a way that enriches both stories, in order to justify its existence. But the thing is, it... doesn't.\n\nThe characters are all pretty dull \u2014 *The Force Awakens* really made it look deceptively easy when it introduced a whole new cast of main characters, because the only one I could really care about in *Rogue One* was poor Bodhi. The story doesn't really pick up until they head for Scarif. And the thing is, after seeing this movie I think I'd rather have left the story of how they got the Death Star plans up to speculation, because this movie just doesn't measure up to whatever I may have imagined the story to be.",

It has flaws (On superficial levels: Couldn't they had just not included Tarkin? Vader's headpiece seemed like a prop just plopped on an actor's head rather than the fluid costume of the OT. Mind-control squid monster outta nowhere) but it was a largely satisfying, visually fantastic and well-acted addition to the canon.\n\n\nI can definitely see some thinkpieces on Star Wars' role in a highly commercialised Disney assembly line of nostalgia being published en masse. I felt that aspect just as I dismiss them for TFA (which I appreciate more now we have something to compare it too).\n\nAlso, Darth Vader's first scene was unnecessary (but the introduction was great). The second was cool. The third was pulse-stopping. A fantastic sequence, one that I will be revisiting over and over. I don't mind his amount of screen time at all. Everyone dying was a move I didn't expect. Reddit's wish came true, and yet I know it will be complained about nevertheless.\n\nRating is either 3.5/5 or 4/5.

            "body": "Overall I really liked it, but I was also a bit disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy biggest issue was with the characters. I just didn't connect with them. They weren't bad, but I never felt any emotion for them a part from a couple of scenes. K2SO was the stand out.\nThe editing was also very odd, lots of cuts where there didn't need to be any. At times the film felt a bit clunky because of that.\nI also found the plot to be rather weak. We already know the outcome so there isn't any real tension. And the film was more about the journey of the characters, which for me didn't really get interesting until the end of the 2nd act, so for the 1st two acts there were times where it did get a little bit slow and there were some scenes that were suppose to be emotional, but they didn't get to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe score was also distracting. It was very generic and had no character or stand out pieces of music. And during some of the action scenes it didn't work with the gritty war tone they were going for. The music didn't fit.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there were some great shots in the trailer, that weren't even in the movie, which is annoying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the action sequences are amazing! One of the, if not the best space battle ever. The action was incredibly immersive and did feel like a true war at times. The war tone was slightly ruined by the score, but not all the time. And there was one particular shot that was stunning. Where the camera was on the wing of an X-WING and you see it go into and drop out of hyperspace and into battle, it was great!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe special effects were flawless, and the practical effects were also great. The costume design and set design was also great. But the sound was the best part. The sound of the blasters, AT-AT's and everything in between was incredible, and during the battle sequences when there is no score and all you here is the sound of the blasters and explosions its incredible!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is some good humor in the film as well and for the most part the acting was good. They also went a bit more in depth with what life is like under Empire rule, but I wish they went even further.\nThe cinematography was also excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the ending was also an excellent lead into Episode 4.\nBut the best part of the film was the Vader scene. Oh, my fucking god was that shit amazing! The entire time I was smiling, it was one of the best scenes I have ever seen in a Star Wars film, it was perfect!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall it was very, very good, but not great. The characters, plot and score were the weakest parts of the film. The characters did have some good moments, but overall I didn't connect with them very well. On a second viewing they may click with me, I hope so. The overall tone felt a bit clunky as well, at times It felt like a true war film, but at other times it didn't, but I think that was mostly to do with the score, which didn't sound like a score for a war movie.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the action scenes, cinematography, set design, costume design, sound design and that Vader scene made it very enjoyable. I hope that on a second viewing I enjoy it even more, now that I know what the film is like. The film also has some good humor.\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel like this is a good stepping stone for the standalone movies. I just wish that they focus more on parts of the Star Wars universe that hasn't been explored yet in the films, like The Old Republic, instead of doing movies based on characters or events we already know about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy overall issue with this movie is that there are so many great parts of Star Wars that haven't been explored yet, and this movie focused on a story that wasn't all that interesting and wasn't all that necessary to tell. I want them to go more into the politics or the civilians of the Star Wars universe. Even though I liked this movie a lot, it felt more like an action movie, than a Star Wars movie. It was enjoyable, but I wanted more out of the characters and the story,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**7.5/10**",

Vader was used the perfect amount (had he not been in this film at all it would have been a better *film* in my opinion, but the fanservice is necessary I guess).\n\nMost side characters are pretty meh, but this isn't a trilogy or miniseries so we've got no time for that. Despite that, I really enjoyed the work of Donnie Yen and Alan Tudyk. Diego Luna's captain pilot guy was admittedly pretty lame and unrelatable.\n\nThe space battles are amazing, the technology allows the camera to go wherever it wants, and this is the single biggest advantage these films have over the original trilogy. The swooping shots through destruction are magnificent.\n\nFor the second big blockbuster film in a row, I feel that Mads Mikkelsen's character is wasted. Just like Dr. Strange, he isn't even given the chance to *act*, and blow us all away. It's a shame, I just want a good Mads performance in my life.\n\nOverall I am very happy with the lack of callbacks, the one time it got too much was the C3PO R2D2 scene. I did not know Moff Tarkin would be in the film, and only realised after the fact that he was CGI at all! I hope that speaks for the quality of the work. I feel like if you knew about it you'd concentrate on it and conclude it was awful. I didn't see it that way.\n\nI'd give it an 8/10.",

I mean granted, I just came back from the cinema so I still need to see how it holds up with time but I am not overhyping it, was probably my favorite one.\n\nPeople complain characters got killed off left and right that you didn't really care about. This I guess is up to each and everyone depending on how easily and how fast you bond with characters. I personally did get invested in the majority of characters in this movie. Mostly cause they were portrayed like real characters(with the exception of our dear two asian guys). Compared to previous Star Wars movies, especially TFA, these character while undeveloped still felt 3 dimensional. \n\nAnd yes they got killed off fast but this was that kind of movie. A group of people on a suicide mission. In previous movies it never felt this desperate. Only deaths I ever cared about in Star Wars I guess is Qui Gon Jin, Yoda, Obi-Wan and Darth Vader but other than that no character on the good side is really killed off.\n\nThis movie was definitely the best one in terms of catching the realism of war. Moral ambigiousness of Cassian was definitely a highlight. \n\nWas a bit too much comic relief altough some lines of K had me laughing and that \"are you kidding me?! I'm blind!\" with Yen was hilarious.  Also a bit too much references, I hope they can stop with that and move fucking forward. \n\n",

They didn't really do much with the shore and the soldiers running through the water.. It's kind of disappointing considering that this beach theme has been the face of Rogue One for the past year, and it just didn't do much for me..\n\nMy favorite part of the movie was the ending. OH MY GOD, just so amazing. I didn't think Disney would go there, but they did.. They killed all the characters but it was in a hopeful way. Really stunning but tragic. I loved it.\n\nVader's introduction felt weird.. This guy is an iconic movie villain, one of the most well-known movie characters of all time, and his walk across that platform didn't do much to me. For a huge, nostalgic character like Darth Vader, it did not feel epic enough and the music was pretty much flat. His reappearance at the end was amazing though. From the breathing in the darkness to the lightsaber's glow revealing him, it was just amazing. His first scene should have either been done correctly or just cut all together..\n\nI preferred The Force Awakens over this, but this was still good too.\n\nI give it a very solid 7/10 or light 7.5/10.",

The visuals: costumes, sets, SFX, cinematography, were all absolutely jaw-droppingly gorgeous. As for the characters, I'm disappointed. Not because they were bad, but because there was so much wasted potential. So many great actors with so little to do. When they met their demise at the end, it didn't have very much emotional weight. Despite all this, I stilled teared up a bit when Jyn and Cassian were swallowed up by the mushroom cloud, so obviously I cared in some way. To wrap up, I'm hoping for an extended cut with more characterization, because then it could very well become my favourite Star Wars movie.",

Moreover to talk again about the rhythm, I think the movie lacked of one or two scene of calm to really makes us feel the weight of what is happening, but on the other hand it nicely managed to show us more of the daily life of the galaxy under the Empire rule. \n\n**To briefly summarize my main critiques, I feel that the movie rhythm wasn\u2019t well-managed at some moments, and that the movie sometimes lacked of ambition, even if it was less insipid than The Force Awakens.**\n\nOtherwise great movie, probably one of the best Star Wars to my eyes, even if I\u2019ll have to watch it again once it\u2019ll be release in blu-ray to truly confirm that.

I mean, don't get me wrong, it was pretty damn good, but just not quite good *enough* to be unnoticeable and it really took me out of the moment. I would actually have been okay with a different actor playing the role. One that jumped into my mind was Bill Nighy? \n\nThe other part of the movie I didn't quite enjoy, which is going to sound crazy because I absolutely love him as a composer, was Michael Gianncino's score. I feel like the tone of this movie was completely different to standard Star Wars as we know it, and yet the music was the same old campy space opera tunes.... I would've rathered something a bit more restrained and minimalistic.... \n\nAlso, the first third did feel like a bunch of information and new character names getting thrown at you in quick succession...

The robot is great and I thought the main bad guy (Ben Mendelsohn) was quite good in his role, but otherwise the characters were pretty serviceable at best, and often nothing more.\n\nSome great action scenes, and some terrific moments involving the star destroyers and AT-ATs, and Donnie Yen adding some martial arts to Star Wars was interesting, but there's also a lot of what we\u2019ve already seen numerous times as far as Star Wars-y action and battles. A little grittier here, but only marginally moreso than TFA. Again, for the most part I thought Force Awakens had a better sense of stylistic visual impact and creative combat.\n\nThe choice to use CGI for Tarkin and Leia was TERRIBLE. Just terrible. Ugh. I literally shook my head each time I saw it, and especially the last time with Leia, which was just so egregiously bad of a choice in that moment, and so unnecessary.\n\nI\u2019ve seen more than one reviewer refer to this as the best Star Wars film yet, or the best since the original.

In the third act, even if he can locate people through sound, how would he differentiate friendlies from enemies when he is shooting?\n\nK-2SO was just C3PO+Chewbacca and Cassian is just an unlikable Han Solo. \n\nJyn Erso is an 18 year old girl and she goes to get the death star plans with Cassian instead of one of the dozen combat veterans and experienced spies. And no body thinks about putting on of the three stormtrooper's armor that came in with the inspector. \n\nIf nobody knew that the Death Star was going to work until they used it for the first time, why didn't Galen Erso just make it not work? or self-destruct when they tried to use it. And why didn't he just give better details about it's location during his hologram message?\n\nWhy was it an ethically ambiguous question for Cassian to not shoot Galen? Cassian already saw the Death Star destroy its target, so his mission to stop Galen before they finished the weapon should have been over. \n\nSaw Gerrara: \"this weird alien thing will make you lose your mind!\" \n\nBodhi: \"I'm a pilot? oh yeah I'm a pilot. I'm fine.\" \n\nSo pretty much everyone died trying to get a message to the rebel ships to target the shield, something the rebels were already doing. \n\nBut somehow when they got that message, the admiral was like \"I have an idea. I'll just destroy everything.\" \n\nHow come that one rebel ship could push one ship, but then that ship cut through the other ship instead of just having all of the ships move together. They are in space. If you push something, it's going to move. It's not going to remain stationary. And I get it, you are supposed to have a suspension of disbelief. But still, one ship can move the other can't?\n\nRebels destroyed the AT-ATs way too easy. \n\nThe only point of having the CGI characters, was to have CGI characters. ",

Another protagonist with some generic paternal storyline, another wise-quipping british robot, along with the ultimately predictable romance between characters that one simply couldn't give the faintest shit about. The special effects were impressive, but my god, when every building is the size of a mountain, when every empire ship is the size of a continent, all sense of scale is lost - nothing feels big. It was like a compression of every movie cliche, and every dead-horse Star Wars trope, in the dullest, most uninventive two hours possible. Perhaps the one positive is that most of the cast were wiped out by the final explosion.

Vader's a badass Sith lord. A few rebel peons didn't really excite me. It's like shooting a bunch of storm troopers.

I hope I will like it more when I rewatch it.\n\nThere were some aspects that I really liked as a Star Wars fan. For example the fact that the Rebellion wasn't just portrayed as a bunch of flawless heroes. I like that characters like Saw Gererra exist too. The visuals were great, the CGI didn't annoy me at all (I actually think that Leia looked pretty good), the action was tense and I really liked the darker tone and especially how everything played out in the end. The ending was pretty satisfying and would've been perfect if I actually cared about any of the characters.\n\nReally, the characters were the main problem of Rogue One. They weren't unlikable, but they were basically non-existent to me. There was no character arc, nothing that would make me care about any of our protagonists which is pretty bad since that ending was supposed to draw an emotional reaction out of us. Instead everyone is just praising Vader because the actual protagonists were so forgettable. Most of the characters didn't have any kind of screen presence. K-2 was pretty good, but I can't really praise Edwards for him since his character was actually created by Bioware.\n\nVader was better than I expected. I appreciate the fact that his german voice sounded almost exactly like his voice in the OT. His big moment was cool so I kinda wished he would have slaughtered some more rebels. Krennic however was the biggest disappointment for me. After all that I've heard about him, I expected a well written backstabbing genius, but he was an incredibly generic villain. He wasn't any more memorable than General Hux.\n\nI think I need to see RO a few more times before I can actually form a final opinion on it. If the characters had been better written and more fleshed out, I would have definitely loved it. But as it is right now, I'm kinda disappointed and hope that Johnson will do it better.\n\nPS: Sorry if my english isn't that good.\n",

The glaring examples were threepio and r2 and the thugs from the Cantina they bump into on the street. The CGI Tarken was not pulled off well IMO (I preferred the different actor they used in the prequels with prosthetics and make up). I thought they did a pretty solid job with young Leia however.\n\nForrest Whittaker's character felt both unnecessary and badly executed. He's a great actor but felt off here. \n\nThe aesthetics of the rebel troops threw me out of the established universe, they gave them a vietnam era US army soldier vibe which felt off, like that awful prequel scene in the bar where robot grid iron is bring played on a screen in the background.\n\nI know a lot of my criticisms sound nit picky, but I started gettimg so bored with the plot and characters that my mind started noticing all the smaller issues as I sat through it.\n\nI did however love the final Vader scene, it was the one point in the movie I was grinning ear to ear.\n\nI do believe this movie ended up being pretty unnecessary. There are so many amazing original stories that could be told in a univese as rich as this one. Here's hoping they move away from expanding on existing cannon and tell us some original stories in the future.\n\nI dont think I'll be rewatching this one for a while. I think once the initial excitement of it being more star wars wears off over time it will be viewed less favourably then it is now. That said I'm really happy so many people seemed to have loved it.",

            "body": "Actually loved it. Way better than Ep 7 which I think upon rewatches is pretty decent. Story was unique. \n\nThose with me not Star Wars fans were really confused in the first hour or so. I agree more could have been done with early characterization of Jyn growing up, or the Saw Guerrera or whatever his name was, because the connection didn't feel very deep to me. I enjoyed the father/daughter relationship more, and was very happy it ended with a sort of beautiful platonic moment when Jyn and the captain dude met their end. \n\nBrilliant segue into the start of A New Hope by the way, I thought it meshes incredibly well with the larger story. \n\nI did have an impossible time learning names in this-- partly because they weren't mentioned enough, I don't know? They left out a bit of exposition I think that could have been helpful in a few key parts, making it easier to follow such as with the planet hopping in the early film that made it really hard to keep things straight. \n\nThe whole bit on Scarif and above was excellent. I was kept in the edge of my seat the entire time and although Jyn herself could have had a little more fighting scenes, the action overall was pretty well done. \n\nCGI faces were... off. Sort of that uncanny valley effect. Cool to have Tarkin, but still not 100%. Vader had one out of character line but overall great. CGI of planets partially exploding was awesome. Choreography generally was excellent. Music was forgettable but not super distracting. Acting was inconsistent but overall pretty good. I could have used a bigger emphasis on how evil the Empire really is, but the attitudes of the Rebellion and an appropriate depiction of the odds they faces was quite good. \n\nI would give it a solid 8 or 9, absolutely a favorite of mine. I find it kind of funny how different a lot of these reviews are- some say too much nostalgia, others bit enough, huge disagreements over actor performance, etc. Me? Just loving that we have new Star Wars films every year and without nearly as much cringe as a few of the prequels were (and no Jar Jar!). I will definitely want to see it a second time in theaters later on to see how it holds up. ",

It works in something like Westworld, where they briefly walk by or something like that (or the initial reflection in the glass).\n\n* Darth Vaders first scene was like the Thanos skype call in Guardians of the Galaxy. Also I would have thought there'd be more distinction between Vader and Saurons sense of style. Kinda odd that he goes to relax in a place similar to one where he lost most his limbs.\n\n* Difficult one to get right, I know, but when the title and the music came up, it felt like a fan-film. \n\nIn saying this, there were a lot of things I like, such as \n\n* Vader going Battlefront 2 on the Rebels\n\n* K-2SO's death (I liked the others, but his was my favourite)\n\n* You really get to see what Stormtroopers and Deathtroopers are capable of when nobody has plot armour\n",

Any good Star Wars film needs a good space battle, and this was easily the best since Return of the Jedi.\n\n* Ben Mendelsohn was a solid Imperial villain.\n\n* Seeing Vader make piecemeal out of some Rebel scum was great. And hearing James Earl Jones as Vader was awesome.\n\n* I really liked the idea of \"radical\" Rebels, and wish they had expanded on this more. The battle in Jedda City felt like a terrorist attack...down to the Rebels wearing turbans.\n\n**CONS**\n\n* From the opening scene, this felt like the most expensive Star Wars fan film ever made. There are way too many \"clever nostalgic throwbacks\" (puts The Force Awakens to shame actually). Rogue One spends all its time reminding us that it's a Star Wars film, but never ends up having its own unique voice or story.\n\n* Speaking of story, this film absolutely did not *need* to be made. Rogue One adds very little to the Star Wars canon. What's the biggest thing we can take away from this story? That the Death Star's weakness was intentionally designed?\n\n* Editing. My God, did this film move WAY too fast. Again, it puts The Force Awakens to shame with its excessively fast pace. We're bouncing from planet to planet with hordes of potentially interesting characters, but the film never slows down to breathe at all. The ending felt extremely rushed.\n\n* The diversity of the cast was a unique touch, but part of me thinks the Lucasfilm/Disney execs only did this to boost their international BO numbers. They had to play down Finn's role in TFA for Chinese audiences, and now we conveniently have two prominent Chinese characters in this film. Hmm.\n\n* Michael Giacchino's score was disappointing. I was really excited for him to do the music, as he's considered the John Williams of his generation. But his motifs were just too bland and unmemorable.\n\nI could probably go on but I'm tired lol. Overall I'd give the film a 6.5/10. Mostly entertaining, but mostly unnecessary.\n\n",

            "body": "Saw it last night, and here are some of my quick thoughts after digesting and sleeping on it:\n\nThe story itself was good. I think we can all agree it was a great premise and something we would all be interested in seeing and it does well in justifying why the Death Star had such a glaring weakness. That being said, there were some pretty bad pacing issues, mostly in the first act. There was so much jumping between planets that it was kind of jarring and made it hard to get invested in the main crew or either of the two more focused characters (Cassian and Jyn). In the climax, I didn't really find myself rooting for them to survive at all and most of the deaths seemed a little forced or phoned in. You knew Chirrut was going to die when he walked out there, you knew Baze was going to die following him out, you knew Bodhi was going to die setting up that communications relay, etc etc. I didn't have a problem with them dying, but just that their deaths were so telegraphed and obviously set up. \n\nHowever, despite their lack of depth, I enjoyed quite a few of the characters. I liked Cassian as a \"do what must be done\" type of rebel and really enjoyed Chirrut, who I originally didn't think would play out very well. Jyn was super bland. Krennic was an **amazing** villain, and I think he had the most believable and clear cut motivations and goals of anyone in the movie. It was also very fitting that he should be destroyed by his own baby. Galen was a little flat... I believed his reasoning, but I just didn't really buy any of his motivation. I wish we could have had more of Mads (who was criminally underused) on screen to maybe get some more background as to why he was working on the Death Star originally and what made him leave the project the first time and so on.\n\nThe pacing in the second and third acts started to flow *a bit* better and built up to what was easily the best Star Wars space battle since Return of the Jedi. I also thought their method of opening the shield gate was pretty inventive and definitely fell within the means of what a ragtag rebel fleet would be able to accomplish with some good strategy, even though they were going up against superior firepower.\n\nThe cinematography was *gorgeous.* There weren't a whole lot of unique or artistic camera shots/angles, but the lighting, sound, set design, and overall aesthetic REALLY captured what a Star Wars movie should be. The Death Star and Rebel Base sets honestly felt like they just pulled them straight out of storage and cleaned them up for this movie. Edwards did an excellent job of making this feel like an old Star Wars movie, and I commend him and his team for that. \n\nFinally, the fan service... I really enjoyed the moments that didn't pull you out of the movie, but *loathed* the ones that absolutely required you to have seen some, if not all, of the other movies. Considering that this is meant to be a stand alone movie, I personally feel like they should have stuck mostly to the former and nixed all of the latter. \n\nExamples:\n\n* Mos Eisley dudes - Actually kind of funny (I feel like my buddy and I were the only ones laughing at their appearance) and serve a small purpose of showing the audience that Jedha City had some rougher characters that could maybe get Jyn and Cassian under a spot light if they didn't keep their heads down. Anyone who has not seen A New Hope loses nothing from this being here.\n\n* Vader/Tarkin appearances - The movie does a decent enough job of implying who they are and their roles in the Empire. A first time viewer is able to figure out that Krennic is second fiddle to these guys, as much as he doesn't want to be. **Sidenote:** The Tarkin CGI was good, but got bad when he spoke. I feel like they should have had him speak from further away, or maybe only use him as a hologram, where it wouldn't be so noticeable. His physical presence was not required at all. Vader looked a little wonky, and JEJ definitely sounds wayyyyyy old now, but I still thought Vader's appearances were an overall net positive (even if you took away the final scene).\n\n* Bail and Mon Mothma talking about Obi Wan - This should have been cut and does nothing but confuse casual viewers. All the fanboys get to go \"HELL YES, he's talking about Obi Wan!\" but anyone else would be so taken out of the movie and confused.\n\n* R2D2 and C3PO - Also should have been cut, pretty much for the same reason as above. I guess most people would recognize them as the droids from the other movies, but that doesn't necessarily mean they need to appear. \n\n* Darth Vader's slaughter and Leia - Her CGI was much better than Tarkin's, probably because it was brief and she didn't speak. However, her appearance was also completely unnecessary. Honestly, from a narrative standpoint, it would make much more sense if the movie ended after Jyn and Cassian died and the rebel plans get uploaded somewhere else. With all of our main characters dead and their mission complete, why should we really care about anything that happens after? I'll go ahead and give this point a pass for the most part though, because Vader's scene was what we have all been wanting for years and totally lived up to expectations. But maybe they could have just ended it with the rebels saying that they have been able to upload the plans to another ship that is still in running condition, and you see a shot of the Tantive IV getting away from the battle. We really don't need to see Leia at all.\n\nOverall, I give it about an 8 out of 10. Great movie that can stand up for casual viewers, but best enjoyed by those who are already incredibly familiar with the Star Wars universe. Now, all that being said...\n\n**HOW THE FUCK DID R2 and 3PO GET ON THE TANTIVE IV?** I may be getting confused on the ships that were in the battle, but it seemed like the rebel flagship was Admiral Raddus' ship, no? This same ship was, to my understanding, the one that had gone off to fight and inspired the rebel fighters to go join them, and if you remember, R2 and 3PO were on Yavin IV at that point commenting on all the fighters heading that way. So then, at the end of the battle, Darth Vader boards what is explicitly defined as \"the disabled rebel flagship.\". After his slaughter of the rebels, the Tantive IV jettisons from the flagship and flies off. So where in this timeline did the droids manage to teleport aboard?",

I get that he was required to save Jyn at the start but it really felt like the whole lock-up-your-allies-because-paranoia thing wasn't necessarily in keeping with the pace of the rest of the film. Him being at odds with the Alliance I guess was possibly was meant to continue on with the metaphor about all of the rebels using \"hope\" and achieving the same goal in different ways? Idk... hard to put my finger on it but just found myself questioning why they bothered with him at the end.\n\nSecond act was outstanding, very Star Warsy without feeling too intentional and fan-servicey. The C3P0 and R2 cameo was a great reminder of what was coming. Thought they did very well with the CGI characters. I'd give it a solid 8.5/10",

However, I will say I thought this movie was great and definitely better than TFA. It was more engaging and the plot was more original than TFA which felt like it took a lot of plot points from ANH and reused them. I did think Rogue One showing all the planets in the beginning was too quick paced but once you got down to the root of the story it became excellent. I know a lot of people felt the characters weren't memorable or you felt nothing for them but I didn't think that at all. I thought you got just enough info to really feel that when they all died you understood what a huge sacrifice these people made just to get even a step closer into defeating the Empire. And even though I might have not gotten every easter egg they put in the film, the ones I did get I loved (Darth Vader at the end especially) and a few I questioned myself (C3PO and R2D2). \n\nRecap: Loved the movie and wish more of the movies were like this one. Definitely seeing again.\n\nOn a side note, which is probably going to get me downvoted, but I thought the scene with Darth Vader's headquarters looked like a scene from LOTR. ",

I can overlook the uncanny valley sort of stuff personally, since seeing them in the film was great and made 100% sense in the plot. \n\nThe battle scenes are by far the best we've seen in Star Wars, the fight on Scarif with the foot soldiers, AT-AT Walkers and then the fighter ships and stuff was almost like a Battlefront game brought to life.\n\nLastly, the fucking **Vader scene at the end** man, words can't describe how badass this character is. I hope if anything, George Lucas can appreciate that he gave film possibly the most memorable villain in history so far, and that hopefully that legacy lives on for a while.\n\nDisney, please find a way to do more Vader stuff, maybe a Vader centred movie before people like James Earl Jones pass on",

It was said that in tight corners, the best form is the defensive form which Qui Gon Jinn resorted to after being cornered by Darth Maul. Qui Gon Jinn is a master of Form 4 which includes wide sweeping arcs of the lightsaber. \n\nObi Wan is said to attain the highest and almost perfected Form III.

K-2SO was like a Darth Vader forcing laughs instead of chokes, in which he succeeded but damn, he might've had the same Comic Relief percentage as Jar Jar. When he wasn't being funny, he was getting killed with you wondering if you should care.\n\nSpeaking of Darth, he and a Princess Leia made by Pixar, both got some clapping from a fella in the audience... he'll have trouble sleeping tonight with that much excitement. Unlike Episode VII, this felt like pure fan service, just because it was poor as an actual film. The final battle felt an hour long, throwing unnecessary complications to deal with while killing everyone possible one by one- the PG-13 way, of course. You shoot something, it dies, you hit something, it faints, unless it's an important character where special rules apply.\n\nThis film repeatedly made it obvious to me that I'm watching it, should feel sad there and laugh there and, oh, Darth Vader, he's cool, right esteemed viewer?

Krennic as well.\n\nThe weird parts: Vader's voice need to tone down the bass a bit, and the words he used and way he spoke seems off. Too wordy IMO.

The starships looked solid and they looked large. The characters didn't suddenly develop skills without training and practicing. That is also how you show someone defecting from the Empire and joining the Rebels (slowly over time not suddenly in a couple of seconds). Rogue One was amazing!!\n\nThe destruction of one temple city had more emotion and action than the destruction of one planet in TFA. That's how you draw your audience in and make them feel something about the destruction of an entire city (or planet). Great work, Rogue One!",

            "body": "Um, wasn't a fan of this one. 5/10, it had enough pros to balance out the cons, but I'm still left feeling very meh about the whole experience. I can't say I felt much for any character at all, they really didn't feel well developed or 'alive', most of them just kind of showed up without context or motivation or personality and then stayed. While I really liked the idea of killing every character at the end (that seems appropriate for a war movie-esque Star Wars film), it really lost it's intended effect when I felt nothing for any of the characters. To be honest, there just this massive disconnect with the emotions entirely, like the story being told was so muddled and poorly delivered to the point where anything could have happened and I wouldn't care.\n\nThe visuals were often pretty good-looking, and the camera work was usually well suited to the action. I wouldn't say these things were better than the visuals/camerawork in The Force Awakens, but not bad at all. The score was more noticeable than many a movie soundtrack are nowadays, but I find that's more because this movie focused on showcasing pretty often. Unfortunately, as far as Star Wars movies go, this wasn't a particularly well written score, it certainly didn't evoke any emotions in me and I can't say any of the themes are stuck in my head or anything.\n\nThe acting was decent...? No one really was given the chance to shine, there weren't many emotion tugging moments which called for a great performance apart from the Russian guy's argument about doing bad things and the Main girl's speech about rebellion, and you know they were both decent in those moments. I wouldn't say anybody stood out as either good or bad.\n\nApart from that, the CGI was mostly ok, passable but not entirely convincing. The CGI Tarkin and Leia were very very distracting to the point where I'd honestly prefer they just got a different actor rather than having me feel like I'm watching an episode of Clone Wars. The action scenes, despite me not having any emotional attachment, were well-shot and pretty exciting. I was impressed with how long they let the final battle go on for, it felt very reminiscent of older war movies which center around these large battles. The final battle had a good development and progression as the objectives changed and the stakes got higher.\n\nMost of my other complaints are very minor. I was annoyed by having the plot repeat itself, I mean is it really necessary to have both of the main character's dads die in the space of half an hour in the movie? Kinda lost me there. There were some minor plot nitpicky things like \"how did the russian guy manage to get through that opening and closing trap door thing after having been shot and falling several metres, and somehow he got up to the top only minutes after the main character\".\n\nOverall, it wasn't a bad movie. It was better than a lot of movies I've seen this year, and worse than a lot of movies I've seen this year. It didn't feel very creative or compelling, but it wasn't badly made or soulless. If you like it that's fine, I can totally understand, but for me it's a 5/10.",

But, as the afterglow of lovely visuals, Vader dominating, and a flurry of deaths and explosions I've come to the rather gutting conclusion that this isn't a great film.\n\nThe film kind of staggers around for the first half, jumping from location to location, and character to character, with no real connecting points. So many characters are introduced they really didn't get a chance to flesh them out, so when they all snuffed it in act 3, it was kind of hard to care. The soundtrack didn't just lack the magic of Star Wars, it lacked any punch, and frankly felt like the same 3 minute track througout various scenes.\n\nIt was still *cool*. I have immense respect and excitement for all the creative steps they took, with the new ships, locations, tech. They did a great job of general worldbuilding, and the various acts of rebellion leading up to the mission felt very 'the whole galaxy is stirring against the empire'. The easter eggs were nice, not too hamfisted (The Ghost, as well as 'General Syndulla' were great to see/hear), and the way they played Tarkin was just awesome.\n\nBut yeah, this is a tough one for me. I'm gonna watch it again, after it's out of cinemas, to get a better grip on it. But it just didn't feel that well put together.",

(these are all new characters, so bear with me) The robot's death was authentic and actually heroic. Donnie Yen's the same. The pilot's death was plausible. The rail gun heavy's death was needless suicide because Donnie Yen bit it and he was sad. Diego Luna's fake out and last minute comeback was predictable and cheesy. Them dying on the beach was fine, I just wish they didn't have to add romance in the last ten minutes. Like, make them scared and need to hold hands out of sheer terror, fine, but don't have them looking longingly into each other's eyes in the elevator after she just accused him of trying to kill her father and lying to them. \n\n\nOh, and I feel like Saul's role got cut to shreds. He was a big player in the clone wars show (on that planet), and had clearly become the Al-Queda to the Alliance's freedom fighters, but why bother going to all of that effort of using that character with that history and injecting him with all of this -new- history just to have him say \"oh, hey, sorry I ditched you, here's a thumb drive, nah you go ahead, I'ma stay here and die.\"\n\nI guess the same could be said for half of the characters in the movie though. \n\nI want to see the director's cut of this movie. \n\nThe structure of the two battles were excellent though. The Rebel Base was both nostalgic and felt brand new at the same time, which made me wonder what they could do to Hoth. Everyone's complaining about Tarkin, but I thought he looked great. Leia... well. Vader going ballistic was great, and really gave a sense of why he's so terrifying in the universe, as well as showing how desperate the rebellion is in a very small scale symbolic way with the disk being passed frantically from troop to troop as they're all cut down. \n\nIt wasn't a great movie, but it did have great parts. I just think a lot of the original concepts got cut out and new ones got shoved awkwardly in, and there was no real work done on smoothing out those transitions. ",

She takes the viewer on a journey to reunite with her father and discover the weapon he built. Along the way, she is recruited by the Rebels and placed under the morally afflicted Captain Cassian Andor. They are also joined by K-2SO, Bodhi  Rook, Chirrut Imwe, and Baze Malbus. Each character is unique and provides a new insight into how people are reacting to the Empire's rule.\n\nThe story is memorable, unique, and swift. Star Wars fans would no doubt find gratifying as the story stitches the prequels to the original trilogy. There are also quite a few Easter eggs in there as well. The first third of the movie is a bit disjointed thanks to poor editing and shoeins. It felt as if the suits and creatives were wrestling over the film's direction, which they probably were. There was definitely a darker, more streamlined film beneath Rogue One but the story served its purpose.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this movie. The plot felt disjointed in the first third but it told a memorable story. ",

            "body": "The complaints about character development are justified and maybe the CGI characters were a bit polarizing. However, I'm pretty torn about the whole character development thing. I agree with the general consensus that there really was no emotional connection to these character but who knows, maybe cramming in a bunch of backstory may have hurt the film. The friendship between chirrut and baze may not have been explained all too well but it was believable and I found both of them to be admirable and charming characters. The whole movie sets up Cassian to be a kind of conflicting and mysterious character but all of that mystery dissipates in the matter of one pep talk. For a lot of the film, there was no reliable character development or what little there was seemed a little rushed. I've seen an argument of \"hey it's a war movie, character development isn't necessary\" and I get the point but this movie had such cool characters (blind monk, man with blatantly overpowered gun that no one else has, half robot Forrest Whitaker,) that I would have loved to see more fleshed out. But, like I said maybe cramming it all in there would have seemed to desperate and obvious and I could be talking about that as a con now IDK. With all that being said, I'll actually go ahead and say it's a good/great (not a great/great, slight difference) movie. God, the action was so fun. The various battles and escapes were so cool looking. Chirrut's staff skills were insanely fun, cool, and quite convincing(as in the choreography doesn't make it look cheesy or fake); and Baze's OP gun fucked ass. Jyn's story was relatively fleshed out and pretty cool. [there's a part where Jyn mentions she fought in Saw's fighters like god that's the type of stuff I wanna learn about](#spoiler). This might be an outrage to many, but K-2SO may be my favorite star wars droid/sidekick type character to date. He was badass, comprised the entire comical backbone for the film, and had a human quality that I actually really enjoyed. ahh! I don't know I just loved him so much. And of course, [the end scene with Darth Vader is the Vader scene that most of us have been wanting for quite some time](#spoiler). Many may disagree with me but the movie is quite long and pretty detailed imo, so I think I'll need to see it again to really understand what is lacking and why it is lacking it. Overall though, the movie just throws a bunch of star wars 'stuff' at you. It had every aspect of a Star Wars movie I love and then some. 8.6/10 ",

Moments that just plain did not make sense or were poorly explained. \n\nThe final battle though, wow. Worst Star Wars movie, maybe.

I liked the little nod to the original WW2 inspiration for Star Wars dog fights by giving the rebel ground forces helmets vaguely reminiscent of American WW2 infantry helmets. \n\nI certainly wasn't expecting it to be as dark as it was, even though there were a few, \"Oh Disney\" moments.

For a fan of the franchise I would say that scene is worth the price of entry alone. \n\nHowever, it were up to me I would fast forward through the whole film to the final battle.

On the one hand, it was a pretty awesome scene  and was the closest I came to caring about these characters.

Whoever thought that this was going to work, it didn't. If it were an animated film I probably would have been amazed. Next to real living actors though... can you say Uncanny Valley?

            "body": "First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, I thought Gareth Edwards expressed a far wider vision of the star wars universe than jj Abrams whilst still being respectful to the OT (unlike TFA). I thought that the acting all around was pretty solid, apart from maybe felicity Jones and forest Whittaker, the visuals all looked great to me and I didn't actually find Tarkin to be too distracting and I thought his and Krennic's interactions were great as they highlighted their vastly differing views/attitudes. \n\nI thought the plot was excellent and that although the trailers did give away too much, there were layers I wasn't expecting, however I do agree with the complaints about pacing in acts 1 and 2. The score was lacking and the only times it did resonate with me were when they re-used the original music, I thought that maybe some if the moments like the two star destroyers colliding would have been far more impressive (although it was great already) with better music.\n\nI believe Vader was handled excellently, although like most I believe he was slightly under-utilised as this may be the last time we see him properly in action. One general complaint that I have however is with reshoots, and many scenes from the trailers not being seen in the final cut. I can forgive this to an extent as I believe it did not negatively affect the movie in any drastic way, however there were a few scenes (such as krennic walking across the water on scarif) that I would have liked to see. \n\nMy biggest praise for this movie however is the plethora of new themes and ideas Edwards managed to fit into the movie whilst it still feeling like a natural prologue to a new hope and the rest of the series. I believe this achievement  should be greatly commended, and the actions of Abrams in TFA addressed as he simply re-hashed the plot of a new hope with the addition of a few characters of note. \n\nIn general I believe this 'experiment' was a great success, with excellent action, narrative, the natural introduction of new and exciting tech, ships etc and generally solid characters. However I do believe people need to wake up to the fact that, although enjoyable TFA was certainly nothing new and that if we as fans wish for the star wars franchise to grow and evolve into something better, we must recognise the shortfalls of both rogue one and TFA whilst voicing our support for the successful new features in both of these movies.\n",

It is inferior to TFA in almost all aspects in my opinion. \n\nThe movie suffers from pacing problems, especially in the first half. The characters are introduced too quickly, and after the team assembled, the second act of the movie becomes a crawl. I failed to connect with any of the characters, sadly. Felicity Jones does a decent job with the material given to her. The movie focuses on these group of characters, but it doesn't give them time to shine, to breathe, to really connect with each other in a way that feels organic. \n\nThe third act then again shifts gears and delivers a glorious finale with great visuals. The problem here is that since I didn't really care about the characters, I wasn't on the edge of my seat watching them overcome the various obstacles in their way. There is a lot of shoehorned fanservice as well, and I'm sure that a lot of Star Wars fanboys will cheer when they recognize certain things.\n\nStill, the movie is enjoyable. The worldbuilding is executed well enough to be engaging. There are lots of funny quips and gags throughout the movie that made me chuckle. The finale is somewhat surprising and even though it has some cringe-inducing dialogue and feels clich\u00e9'd at times, it is still very well paced and told. \n\nI can recommend it to people who generally like the Star Wars universe, and to people who like action movies. Don't expect anything revolutionary, but it is entertaining and definitely not a waste of your money and time.\n\nEdit: Lol, blind fanboys down voting me. Get a life and learn to accept other people's opinions. Jesus. ",

The biggest problem being the tone, and the fact they never seemed to inact the desperatate sense of survival and forboding doom they kept fucking talking about. \n\nThe first scene was awful. The actors acting was fairly wooden, and the mother's death was completely pointless. She should have either stayed with her husband, or stayed with her daughter. Even if she had killed General who gives a fuck she would have been killed and her husband captured. \n\nSpeaking of Orson Krennic he was such a shitty villian. I kept wanting him to die, not because he was a compelling villian, but because he was a fucking waste of screen time. Outside the beginning of the movie where he captures Galen Erso General Useless does nothing to effect the plot at all. When the main 'villian' can be removed from the movie and it doesn't change a fucking thing that is bad. \n\nThe movie also fell into the fucking marvel syndrome of putting humor in every tense scene. Humor works, and makes the characters more human if you do it occassionally. See John McClain in Die Hard for a good example of that, but when you do it in practically every tense scene it doesn't make it better it just kills the tension. I am supposed to feel stressed if the characters are in danger and you did nothing to help that. \n\nNot to mention the fucking plot holes in the name of 'fan service'. Why did they show C3P0 and R2-D2 on yavin 4? How the fuck did they get back to Princess Leia's ship to be there for the assault. They wouldn't, and thus A New Hope would never happen all because they wanted to put in useless fan service that jolted me out of the action. \n\nAlso Darth Vader's \"choke on your aspirations\" lines was pathetic and should never have been put in that movie. God, that line was so stupid and out of character for him",

            "body": "A Star Wars story for Star Wars fans. \n\n\nGareth Edwards got to play around in the Star Wars universe within some set limitations and he did it really well. The locations are visually stunning, the worlds within them are packed full of that awesome Star Wars aesthetic and the action, especially the final battle, is probably the best we\u2019ve ever witnessed.  \n\n\nGoing into the movie I was worried that having yet another robot sidekick in K-2 was going to be hard to pull off. My worries were unfounded and I think K-2 is going to be another fan favorite and he was easily among the best characters.    \nThis sentiment was shared by the other people I watched the movie with and when leaving the cinema we realized that K-2 was the only character that really stood out. That\u2019s not to say the other actors put in bad performances, but we never really got to know them properly.   \nI think the issue comes from the fact that the story is in focus rather than the characters. We are being told the epic story of how the plans to destroy the Death Star were stolen and the characters are just a vehicle to that story. The thing is that most of us already know the basics of that story and would much rather get to really know the team that pulled off the spectacular heist. \nAs someone else in here mentioned, we care when they all die at the end but not nearly as much as we should have.   \n\n\n**The Good:**  \n- Some people will dislike and get confused by all the planets and locations we see early on. I loved getting a brief glimpse of such varied landscapes and settings. To me it felt like Edwards received concept pieces for a bunch of different planets and couldn\u2019t decide which one to chose so the added them all and I loved it.  \n- There are some truly breathtaking shots. The opening with Krennic arriving to take away Galen on the stark black volcanic planet with the contrasting green plants was one of my favorite. The shot of Vader arriving to greet Krennic and having his shadow appear on the wall was maybe a bit on the nose but oh so powerful.   \n- The scale difference going from the TIE fighter to Star Destroyer to Death Star in one shot was pure goosebumps.  \n- K-2 could have strayed too far into becoming a TARS rip-off but he didn\u2019t and turned into one of, if not the best character. Probably the death that hurt the most to be honest.   \n- I really enjoyed Diego Luna as Cassian. Having a rebel soldier who actually has flaws and isn\u2019t just a straight up good guy was refreshing. I though his dialogue to explain to Jyn why he had considered killing her father was great and his speach when they joined to help out Jyn was heartfelt. He was a guy brought up in the rebellion and was willing to do anything to give them a fighting chance against the Empire.  \n- The final battle was just completely epic. It took what worked in the temple battle from last year and just added to it. Being able to switch between air and land combat so effortlessly and make both of them look so good is amazing.   \n- The final Vader scene was the perfect ending. His entrance in Episode IV is a classic and they somehow managed to make the preceding events even better. Every time I watch IV from now on I\u2019ll be reminded of the awesome scenes that have just transpired when he enters Leias ship!  \n- Seeing Leia at the end was the perfect ending. The CGI was a bit jarring but unlike Tarkin it worked for since it was in such a short scene.\n\n\n\n  \n\n**The Bad:**  \n- There were too many new characters. I liked them all and the actors did their best but there just wasn\u2019t enough screen time for all of them.   \n- Krennic started off being set up as a great bad guy but I felt he got cut severely short. He got undermined at every turn by his superiors and never really got to show off his capabilities.   \n- I had no idea Tarkin was going to be in this movie. He definitely had to be in the movie considering what it was about but I feel like he got too much screen time. The CGI really stood out to me and made his scenes jarring.   \n\n\nOverall a really enjoyable stand alone movie in a great universe. I have a hard time seeing a Star Wars fan who doesn't enjoy this movie.\n\n \n",

Sort of confusing.\n\n- Killing absolutely everyone in some ways felt...forced? Like \"we don't need a sequel so let's just kill them all.\" It didn't have much of an emotional impact on me because some of the death scenes happened so fast - so it felt a little nihilistic without as much emotional impact as it should have had.\n\n- The very end felt a little rushed.",

This is very important to rewatchability.\n\n- The CGI worked for me, I don't know what I was expecting, when they showed Grand Moff Tarkin's back with his hairstyle and obviously it was him; but if it had been different-looking actors, it would have been worse.\n\n- The fan service was plenty, but somewhat subtle and integrated into the film.\n\n- The hope theme really worked more than in any other Star Wars film. It was good that they exploited it because this is, after all the *most* desperate situation out of all the films. I liked how even Mon Mothma was going to give up after they found out about the Death Star, which is realistic.\n\n- The guilt and redemption theme. Especially with Krennic and Erso both dying by the weapon he and her father respectively, had worked on. Especially with Krennic's last shot being him looking up and knowing what it's like to be on the other side of the weapon he built. \n\n- How they showed the 'good guys' were morally ambiguous.\n\n- The Hammerhead ship was cool.\n\n- The fact that Krennic was not killed by either Tarkin or Vader. That was a pleasant surprise because usually the mid-level commander fails and is killed. \n\n- The chain link of effort where almost each character gets to be indispensible at a certain point.\n\n- The battle bravery actually did feel like bravery. You really felt that these people were heroes.\n\n- The fact that it's all about information, or intelligence, as opposed to people, or blowing something up; and they showed that many of the hurdles are technical in nature. I felt this was realistic. \n\nCons:\n\n- Not enough humor, especially in the first half.\n\n- The dialogue at times wasn't as clever as it could have been with a better writer.\n\n- It could have used more character development. While I can't say I didn't care for the characters, I didn't care as much as I could have. But I think that's actually fine because one of the themes of this film is that while we all have our story, it's about the larger cause and no one is really *that* special. In fact they went all out with this theme and laid it on pretty hard at the end. \n\nOverall I would have to say it was the most enjoyable Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back, and perhaps the most realistic one ever.",

I definitely noticed this flaw but I didn't think a whole lot of it until the finale of the film *(which in all honesty, is fucking epic)* here you realise all these characters have interacted with each other and met their untimely fate, which would be depressing if we knew shit about them. ^is ^that ^asian ^guy ^a ^Jedi ^or ^what? ^am ^I ^missing ^something ^here? I also couldn't remember any of the names, I'm assuming the robot was only there to add a comedic element to a kinda dark film, he's also a good excuse for merchandising, yet they said his name like once and called him K later in the film, can't empty parent's wallets with that :v. However, he was for sure a fun character, in fact the only reason I remembered Diego Luna's characters name is because the robot said it. In reference to the other characters names, it was just:\n\n* the blind guy\n\n* the guy from nightcrawler\n\n* FOREST WHITTAKER\n\n* cool asian guy who I recognise but can't work out where from\n\n* \"is this re-used leia footage or CGI?\" *(also that scene was awesome, really added to an already amazing final act)*\n\nOverall I just found myself not caring when everyone died. Although the tragedy was thrilling to watch.\n\nI also liked the Cinematography, really important in a movie where the setting is the basis of the movie. It was beautifully done *(((opinion)))*\n\nAs for acting, it was pretty good for a movie where no characters are fleshed out and don't do a whole lot. It's always good to see Mads Mikkelsen though, I like that guy. Although I do have some issues:\n\n* Jyn is a boring character, just a pretty face with nothing real exciting to add to her. Her storyline made me felt like I was watching Suicide Squad again. Criminal gets taken out of prison to go on a mission that's way out of their skill level because well, they're only human. Yet somehow they pull some hero shit out of their asses and save the day! Although Jyn's story ends quite darker than anyone's in SS ^^El ^^Diablo?\n\n* Diego Luna's character also felt a bit boring to me, once again theres nothing exciting to add to him.\n\nOther than these flaws, I liked the film a lot. The action sequences were exciting and well done, and the plot was done pretty well. Also a Stormtrooper killed someone in this movie, idk how I feel about that :v ^^but ^^where ^^were ^^the ^^wilhelm ^^screams??\n\nI'd give it an **8/10**, that seems justified enough. \n\n*tl;dr: movie good character development bad*",

Only the droids felt gratuitous.\n* Battles were awesome, planets were awesome, world building - awesome.\n* Loved the Imperial Air Speeders.\n* Vader scenes were great. CGI Tarkin was great (I bet they considered using this tech for the Han Solo movie at one point it's that good. Only the eyes give it away sometimes).\n* Bail/Schmidt is the first time we've seen a solid through-line from Lucas to Disney with the movies.\n* Enjoyed the new characters, shame they all had to die so we effectively reset to zero. We didn't actually need everyone to die, buy hey-ho. It's freaking bleak though, man. This is rebels imagined as terrorist insurgents rather than swashbuckling heroes.\n* I can see this being a set up for a ROGUE SQUADRON movie borrowing the call-sign as a mark of respect. PLEASE DO THIS.\n* Vader's 'castle' being on Mustafar was a nice touch, as was using Red and Gold leader.\n* Whitaker as a 'poor man's Vader' was a nice touch.\n* I saw a rebel 'transport' amongst the fleet. What the hell was it doing there? It's a cargo vessel! Disney need to be on top of shit like this. \n* Zero reason for Leia's ship to be there in the heat of battle. They could've beamed the transmission out to her waiting at a nearby system instead and it make more sense.\n",

The beginning was so incoherent I could barely keep up with who is what and what is who. At least it got good after the first half and had a satisfying ending even if it was rushed as all hell. \n\nEveryone's acting wasn't that spectacular. Forest Whitaker was laughable, Donnie Yen was embarrassing  (even though he had a few good jokes), Mads Mikkelsen phoned it in, K2SO was a walking quip dispenser, and the rest of the main group overacted to high heaven. At least Felicity Jones did pretty good. She's a much better actress than Daisy Ridley tbh.\n\nThe score was the most generic orchestraic shit I've ever heard. Not a single theme was memorable and it all followed the same generic action movie orchestraic beats. It's like they barely even tried with the music or whoever did the music wasn't prepared to make so much of it because a lot of it just felt like filler noise.\n\nSame goes for all the new ship designs. Some of them were so lazy and uninteresting. Any Imperial ship looked like gray and boring paper mache crane. At one point the Stormtroopers were riding in what looked like a literal fucking M1 tank from WW2, then there were Jihad Rebels and in the final act some of them were wearing fucking American Vietnam-like bucket helmets. I despise the prequels but at least they had good and not lazy ship designs.\n\nThere were a lot of plot holes, especially that blind guy who kept annoyingly saying his Force motto which gave him more plot armor than anyone in the entire series.\n\nAt least it was decently well shot and the CG was fucking fantastic. Vader wrecking shit was the greatest scene in the whole movie and it did tie up in a neat and satisfying little bow, even if it ended so quickly and abruptly with barely any time to breathe at all.\n\nDefinitely didn't think it was as good as people like to pretend it is. But, if you're a fan of big dumb sci-fi action movies, then you'll like this regardless because it's Star Wars.",

Felicity Jones' character is stricken by a poor script and not much better acting. She has 0 of the vibrancy and depth of Rey. I mean I can't even remember her name from the movie. The rest of the rebel side isn't much better. The Droid was a nice addition, and I thought the Asian buddies were interesting, but other than that man it's dull and hard to listen to. Seemed like there was so much dialogue that either didn't have context or didn't contribute anything. For a story that seems pretty simple it really felt like they made it hard to follow.

Like, can I get this shit written down for me on a notecard?)\n\nOverall, worth the admission, but I'm not going to go see it 4 times like TFA.

The last 30 minutes alone are near perfection. Almost felt like the love child between Star Wars and Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge for a more recent example. I don't think kids will enjoy it as much as older audiences but who knows. Also what is with this movie and recreating old faces? It was fine when Tarkin showed up but as it kept going I counted like 5 maybe 6 other CG recreated characters. I give 9/10. It is a shame we won't ever see more of these characters though, they were exciting to follow and quite memorable to me.",

The final act was phenomanal though and exciting on every level, I loved the ending alot more than force awakens in some ways but I still liked the force awakens alot more.

At the same time it felt like it worked better as a movie than *TFA*. The plot was tight, for example, but I have to say the leading couple didn't work for me that much, neither did Whitaker's character. I think the lack of love/sexual tension/emotion argument some have put out has become my biggest criticism of these two last movies.\n\nLight saber use, the humour, Mendelsohn, Mikkelsen (but maybe slightly wasted?) get a thumb up from me. CGI Tarkin didn't bother me \u2013 I actually was impressed, even if I could slightly see it, and loved seeing him again! One of my favourite characters on repeated viewings of Ep. IV.

I told my friend at the beginning that no matter what, if there was a good space combat sequence I'll take it and man did we get some.  Ending absolutely sold me, I got chills at Vader just decimating the troops.  Before it started I was thinking \"man how nice it would be if they went a little darker\" because the Disney brand worries me but damn did I not expect this to be fucking Saving Private Ryan in terms of lives lost to sacrifice.  \n\nPeople will complain about Leia cgi and I partially agree but not because of the job they did- that was actually decent. It's the fact that they couldn't trust the audience.  Once it became clear the plans needed to be evacuated quickly, I completely understood that they would be bookending this movie with A New Hope, which is an awesome idea.  It's almost like they didn't think we'd \"get\" what was happening unless they shoved Leia in our face and if that wasn't enough she said that piece about hope.  We know IV is called A New Hope! \n\n Other complaints are the cameos (and the direct copy of the Yavin ship tracking shot) but I know that's the execs' fault.  Thought they would just shove all that shit in VII and be done with it but such is the way of Disney films apparently.  Doesn't really detract from the film, just makes you roll your eyes.  It took a little while to get going which is fine because I understand the need for exposition but they were going crazy in the first 15 mins jumping from new planet to new planet and just bombarding me with things I had no context for. Once they slowed the fuck down on the temple planet  is when I settled in to the film.  Also, the score was a bit lacking but I love Michael Giacchino and he was given the impossible task of filling John William's shoes so that's forgiven.  I will have to see it again to solidify my opinion, especially with how I feel with the first act of the film but I do recommend that people see it if anything for the action-packed ending.\n\n",

And you realize that these characters aren't that flesh out. And then thing just feel like they are happening. The films so poorly paced that you barely have any time to catch up with it . \n\nAlan Turdyk, Forrest Witaker and Dannie Yen stole the show. Deigo Luna is goddamn terrible in this film. So much so I felt angry whenever he popped up in the film. \n\nThe way the film ends is actually a lot of fun and left me happy. Overall, I didn't hate it but I didn't like it. It's just, fine. \n\nAlso, Vader didn't really need to be in the film excited for his last scene. ",

The story worked well and generally across the board felt well paced and staged out.  \n  \nI hated the cgi tarkin/leia, they looked awful and shouldn't have been in the film (should have seen Tarkins reflection in a single shot, max.), and I heavily disliked the vader scenes also. Very much on the side of that he shouldn't have been in the film. It was so refreshing to have no jedi/sith craziness permeating a very human story. Throwing people around, slicing them in half... it was stupid and just fan service, pure and simple. I see a lot of people fangasming over it in the comments below though, so I suppose there's no accounting for taste. I did however LOVE the bacta tank scene. If that had been all we saw of him, I would have been very happy. Fantastic scene, haunting, interesting, dark and weird. Amazing.  \n\nDirector Krennic was fantastic, I wish they'd let him be more dominant rather than so subservient and kept down by Tarkin. Mads Mikkelsen was fabulous, and I kind of wish they'd let K2SO be a bit more assassin droid-y and super dark humoured, but he was great across the board really too.\nLots of stuff in the trailers that isn't in the final film. Definitely looks like they heavily switched up the ending and the survivability of certain characters.  \n\nVisually awesome across the board though, every planet was just gorgeous (with the asteroid city being the only real exception - very prequelly). Darth Vaders castle was also a bit dumb and his voice and costume both felt kind of wrong.  \n\nI'd give it like a 8.6/10.",

It almost makes me angry that they gave such little screen time to such a great actor. I mean, where did all those scenes with him in the trailers go?\n\nIt felt like the writers decided that everyone had to die before they even considered if it felt natural for the story to go that way. The character deaths just felt like they were ticking boxes.\n\nThere needed to be more aliens.\n\nThe action scenes were too long. I know it is supposed to be a war movie but how many faceless stormtroopers can get killed before you just become jaded toward the action.\n\nNow, for what will be, no doubt, an unpopular opinion: There was no reason other than fan service for Vader to be in this movie.\n\nThe comments saying that this is a Star Wars movie made for Star Wars fans make me roll my eyes. No, this is a Star Wars movie which like TFA (though not to the same degree) was made for the group of fans who have held this franchise hostage for the last 15 years complaining about how the prequels ruined their childhoods.\n\nWhile I did find this movie much more pleasant than TFA I could still feel the fan service and the checkboxes being marked off as I sat through it.\n",

Every time we pause the action to meet a major Star Wars character you can practically hear the production grind to a halt to fit them in, the characters barely leave an impression despite heroic efforts on the part of the cast and production team (save K2-90 or whatever who is great but feels like he's from a different movie), and the final moments for our main characters and the literal movie are focus-group awful. \n\nAgain there are parts that really work-- the final sequence is filled with brilliance, the antagonist oozes retro-cool, the scenes we get with Darth Vader are among the best in the entire Star Wars canon, and those endearing squid guys make another appearance and they're great. \n\nIt's a B at best and that's with the generous desire to enjoy a Star Wars movie free of \"chosen one\" horseshit for a change.

I also really enjoyed the story as it was told.\n\nThere were a few issues, but none really made me regret seeing the movie or made me feel like I'd decline going to see it again;\n\nFelicity Jones was very very flat. Outside of one scene in particular, I never really enjoyed her character or bought into the role. She was pretty wooden, and it seems she just didn't fit the character well enough.\n\nCharacter names were an issue. We're beaten over the head with the name Jyn Erso, but I would be struggling to remember anyone else's name really. Not sure if they weren't used enough, or if they were just that unmemorable, but it really was disappointing to leave the theater saying, \"That blind dude! Forest Whitaker's character! The main character guy!\"\n\nThe beginning is slow. It feels glacial, and luckily is saved by some solid actors giving good performances in their brief supporting roles. Thankfully this turns around about 1/3rd of the movie in, but it did have me kind of worried for a bit.\n\nSome other positives:\n\nTons of Star Wars goodness including a bunch of easter eggs with even more I probably missed.\n\nOutside of Felicity Jones most of the actors really bring their characters to life.\n\nThe CGI on Grand Moff Tarkin was pretty solid. I know a lot of people will complain, but I think Tarkin looks seriously sinister with the CGI face. It really added something I didn't expect.\n\nWill probably see it again, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

It almost makes me angry that they gave such little screen time to such a great actor. I mean, where did all those scenes with him in the trailers go? \n\nI don\u2019t like how they changed the way Krennic acted toward Vader. In the trailer he was confident and was not afraid of Vader yet in the film they made it look like he was slightly afraid of him. \n\nIt felt like the writers decided that everyone had to die before they even considered if it felt natural for the story to go that way. The character deaths just felt like they were ticking boxes.\n\nThere needed to be more aliens.\n\nThe action scenes were too long.

The Dr. Evazan / Ponda Bobba encounter in the street, Vader's extremely cringeworthy force choke sentence, the Red 5 shoutout in the space battle. And I'm sorry, but the corvette pushing the star destroyer was fucking dumb, they could have done better with another plot device. Some throwbacks/fandom was definitely good, Dutch Vander, Garvin Dreis was awesome, Tarkin's CGI was well done, and was that Bast Castle (I hope so)? 8/10 IMO.

            "body": "I'm surprised this is getting such a positive reaction. While the overall plot beats were good, every individual scene was pretty abysmal. Elements were introduced constantly with no real purpose (the torture squid thing, robot mentioning he can survive in space, the need to open a comm line to tell the Rebel fleet to lower the shield when they were already doing that). Characters repeated their current goal constantly just in case you'd forgotten it from 2 minutes ago. Almost every conflict was brought up out of nowhere and then a deus ex machina erased it. AT-ATs are apparently made out of paper now and Darth Vader likes to cheese it for the camera (that choking line was basically a dad joke).\n\nThere were a few redeeming things: the action was flashy (even if it usually made no sense in context), the new planets were more interesting than anything in VII, and the robot was occasionally funny. But overall it was not a good movie.\n\nBut most importantly, WHY WAS LEIA AT THE BATTLE?! Her father just said he'd send her to get Obi-wan, so it makes no sense for her to say \"oh, I guess I'll tag along with this fleet but then stay docked to the flagship so I can't even contribute my ship's paltry weapons to the fight\".",

[Why not have Vader show down with the actual characters we've come to know and like? Cutting through random rebels for 45 seconds is just filmmaking malpractice when you're given such an iconic character to play with, and especially because Edwards does a decent job getting the audience to like this band of rogues. Donnie Yen, Saw Guerrerra, Erso and the others would have had more powerful endings against Vader rather what they got in the movie.](#spoiler)\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I was so looking forward to Donnie Yen and Guerrerra in particular making a last stand against all odds.\n\nWould have been a great way to add to Yen's character by an acknowledgement from Vader.\n\nAnyway, did anyone else get the feeling that the final [Vader rampage](#spoiler) was added during reshoots after Edwards were seeing the fans hoping for a Vader comic / Vader Down type of scene showing him pissed off and near the height of his powers?\n\nIt just seemed tacked-on in a weird way, and as basass as it was it could so easily have been iconic.\n\nEdit: final third of movie had some incredible moments and momentum. Still worth seeing his movie for that and other things. But so much of the particulars of how things played out seemed anticlimacticic and kind of random.",

Bad CG characters (should have been look-a-likes with makeup, prosthetics and using the same voices). Fantastic acting, good acting and bad acting (Forrest Whittaker, are you kidding me? He's usually amazing). Just felt kind of boring and flat. Was never very engaging. It was a lukewarm movie right up until the final mission is taking place. Even Vader had the cheesiest line of the damn movie. And all this talk of \"Creature characters!\" Lol, yeah, they literally had split second moments. Basically \"Star Wars decoration\". Never trusting critics again. And anyone who thinks this is great, needs to understand what actually makes movies good and exciting and engaging. It had good intentions but it was completely average. Makes The Force Awakens seem even better. (And I only ever thought FA was \"pretty good\") So very disappointed.

The most unsettling thing about it though is how it really calls attention to just how fucking awful The Force Awakens was. Multicultural cast done right. Female lead that isn't a Mary Sue. Original ideas. Great action. Comedy that actually is pretty funny and feels organic for the most part. Doesn't treat the audience like children. I'm not sure it needed to get made, but for the idea, the execution was really well done. I'd like to say that this movie is to The Force Awakens what the Original Trilogy is to the Prequels, but at least the prequels were original ideas and an attempt at giving color to what happened before A New Hope. \n\nIn this case The Force Awakens stands on its own as some awful fan fiction Burger King Kids Club crossover while this beats out the entirety of the prequels (demonstrating what the prequels had potential to be) and stands with the OT. It's hard to rate them but you have the OT + Rogue One, then you have maybe Revenge of the Sith, then Clone Wars and Phantom Menace tied for the worst and again you have The Force Awakens standing on its own outside of the Star Wars universe as soft-reboot garbage. Somewhere in there you have The Clone Wars cartoon series which managed to somehow be better story telling than the prequels, but since it's not a movie I figured I'd just exclude it.",

But even those who are new to the franchise will enjoy it. This film was much more action-oriented than most of the others. A lot of the battle scenes were large scale and top notch. That moment when the AT-AT walkers broke through the smoke was awesome! Ben Mendelsohn was a serviceable bad guy, but I thought he was also a very cliche sniveling, over-ambitious archetype. The final few minutes of Vader slashing through the rebels was something we've all wanted to see for a very, very long time. Donnie Yen as the blind warrior monk stole the show for me...awesome character.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe actors were often flat and the writing was sub-par at best. So much potential was wasted. Not sure if Disney's deadlines and demands pushed this movie out too early or what the problem was, but they definitely fell short.\n\nThe Ugly:\nVader's voice was horribly off to the point of it being distracting. Worse than that though was the choice to use CGI for Tarkin and Leia. The bright spot is, we only had to see about 5 seconds of Leia, but it was still shockingly bad. Tarkin is a great character, but he got far too much screen time and the longer we had to look at him, the more obvious it became that he wasn't real. It was awful.\n\nOverall, it was a decent movie. I expected far less. Typically I see Star Wars movies at least twice in theaters, but I probably won't see Rogue One again, even thought it was better than I, II, and III in my opinion.

Also they constantly talk about the force, in the original trilogy they don't throw the force in your face every 15 minutes, but this movie does.\n\nThe cg was horrid, the characters were quite boring and the last act battle wasn't cool to me because I felt no connection to these characters.

Also dat Vader scene at the end, very effective and quite terrifying really.

Having slept on it, I'm fairly confident calling it an 8/10, 7.5 at worst. I think it would have benefitted from a plot streamlining - that opening throws 3/4 planets at you, but I feel like it would have worked better if Cassian already had a small team of sorts and was on Jedha. I also would have dropped Saw or made it so he had the plans.\n\nFor how messy that first half is in terms of plotting, the second half when the objective is clear - get the plans - is the most focused part and where it all works. I wouldn't have minded more time to develop character - for example, when they're approaching Scarif, it would have been better if Jyn and the others had a moment to talk instead of Cassian coming straight down to say they're landing.",

And omg, Saw's character was so badly developed. What about chirrut imwe and baze--what's their connection to the rebellion??!!\n\nNevertheless, I enjoyed the film a lot. Great dialogue!! It's nice to see blue milk at the beginning too haha that tickled me so much. Man, I missed Star Wars universe. I also liked how Cassian and Jyn's implied romance (via bonding over adverse circumstances) was subtle and not melodramatic...\n\nI know Darth Vader was there for fan service but I thought his inclusion in the film was pretty relevant--really tied well into A New Hope! So good! Of course, I get that it's hard to flesh out everyone's backstory because the film is essentially focused on the (suicide) mission. \n\nRogue One gets 4/5 stars from me.",

Things like:\n\n* *The Death Star was designed to implode.*  Sorry, but this was *never* an important plot hole to me - it's part of the fun of IV, and retroactively making it the plan of the DS' designers was an unnessecary added dimension to a simple \"steal the Death Star plans\" plot, and confuses some moments in IV - when Leia says, \"I only hope when they analyze those plans a weakness can be found.\"  (Apparently she missed the meeting with *every fucking person in the Rebellion*.)\n\n* *Darth Vader's \"lair.\"*  I thought this was a stupid and extraneous detail, that seemed like something a 6-year-old would dream up - the super bad guy lives in an evil volcano lair.

As Plinkett points out in his review, the prequels suffer from an *over* important Vader - when we meet him in IV, he's just a boss in the Imperial food chain with some history and interest in voodoo.\n\n* *The same crystals that power lightsabers power the Death Star.*  I like my Star Wars universe big and vague - whenever they start to over-explain things (midichlorians) and make connections where none are necessary I think it ruins some of the fun and makes it a little duller.\n\nAnyways - those are my first thoughts.",

Pretty damn good, performing like an Iron Man sequel.\n\nThe Force Awakens had a 92 Rottentomatoes, 82? Metacritic, A Cinemascore, 92 Rentracks, 900+ mil/2 bil split. \n\nHowever, even then, here in Neckbeardia, we will hear how TFA was shit and this film was the best since Empire. I enjoyed both, but I'm just lucky the conventional wisdomers aren't in charge at Lucasfilm. Star Wars would end up a middling franchise where we get films like Star Trek Beyond that fanboys gush over for purity but struggle with then general pop. Because of films that are expertly crafted for public consumption like TFA, we get films like this one. ",

The very SW Battlefront appearance of Vader, etc. There was lots to appreciate as someone who enjoys the SW universe in multiple mediums like the games etc. The action was also great and not just in an explode-y kind of way to show they spent money on affects, but the battle actually had meaning and stakes. The Vader hallway scene felt like a horror movie, and it really worked.\n\nI really liked that they didn't pussy out on the main characters deaths. Nobody should have lived through that, there couldn't be a happy ending or it completely negates the stakes of ANH. They took a massive risk by killing off their entire cast, and it really pays off as an audience member.\n\nI didn't like:\n\nThe lead girl and guy. Zero charisma in either. Hell I didn't even know the guys name, and thought he was a side character until he just kept hanging around. The obviously forced diversity. It just felt really tacky the way they made sure that every single flavor of human existed in this film as if to say \"See, we're totally diverse OMG PLEASE DON'T SAY IT'S ALL WHITE PEOPLE AND ALIENS PLEASE PLEASE\". It was really blatant and poorly executed, figuring that not one of the stereotropes can be named. (Although I gotta admit, I did like the Toph character, was interesting to see Toph as an older asian male, but still, one of the best chars charisma-wise even if he did have really shitty earth bending skills)\n\nThe last 30 mins of the movie makes up for the first 2 hours.

I didn't care about any of the characters, and CGI leia looked embarrassingly bad. Also, Vaders voice? What was up with that? Guess JEJ just doesn't have it in him anymore, it was a bad performance. \n\nI loved the Force Awakens, plot holes and all, and cannot understand anyone saying this is better than TFA or up there with Empire.

The plot transition to ANH was perfect!\nBut there were a couple of things that bothered me.\nFirst of all the CGI characters looked like from a PS3 video game. They felt completely out of place and really took away some of the immersion into the movie. Not sure why they couldn't make them better, because I think a lot of Hollywood movies were already able to bring it to a point where the audience doesn't notice as bad.\n\nThen there was Darth Vader. Yes it was awesome to see him again and slice those rebels up like they were butter. But why the hell did they give him red eyes? Darth Vader's eyes in his helmet are black! I would have expected they would get the details of one of the most iconic movie villain right. This is something that could have been easily avoided.\nAlso he seemed way to fit and light on his feet. In ANH he's very heavy footed and moves slowly.\n\nI'm comlaining on a high level here. Because overall I thought it was really good. But those things really struck out to me.",

In *A New Hope* stormtroopers goes in first, to clear the place out, then Vader goes in. He was never a foot soldier in the original trilogy. If he was, why didn't he do it again the second time around when they captured the princess' ship in ANH? Was he tired?\n\nThe reason the lightsaber is so awesome in *A New Hope*, is because it is used sparingly and primarily between force-sensitive beings. It's *'an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.'* as Ben Kenobi puts it - used by *'knights'*. Not some hack-and-slash videogame-weapon. Maybe I'm just an old cynical man, but it just felt out of character for Vader to behave like that.\n\nI think *Rogue One* works fine as a war-movie set in the Star Wars universe, I don't really see a reason why the lightsaber must be forced into everything that has to do with Star Wars, ultimately I think it degrades the weapon and the franchise.\n\nEDIT: Good old /r/movies downvoting opinions in a **DISCUSSION** thread. what a discussion.

People also failing to realize ITT how the cinematography was incredibly respectful to the source material. The three time nod to the ship landings and leaving on the Yavin 4 base? The complex and conflicted characters? \n\nThe mysticism of the force portrayed just how it was meant to be which harkened back to the original trilogy? The genius of casting Donnie Yen to underscore that mysticism? This film was easily a 10/10 in my opinion. Gareth Edwards completely outperformed the force awakens here. People ITT complaining that a story needed to be woven. And then saying that the last half of the movie is the best star wars they've seen are completely off base. \n\nForest Whitaker was an amazing choice for Saw Guerrera. His facial expressions and character portrayal was on point. The grittiness of each scene completely outperformed the scenes of TFA. So much more to say on this",

So considerable time must pass before Leia is captured by Vader if she has to reconnect with R2 first?\n\nEdit: now I'm remembering the opening shot of ANH with the star destroyer chasing the rebel ship. Am I correct in assuming it is the same ship Leia escapes in? Which makes me wonder even more how she met up with R2?\n\n\nEdit 2: Alright, so I just threw on ANH and sure enough, the opening text confirms she's on her way home from the battle, being pursued by the Empire at the start of the movie and the ship is the same one we see her escape in during the final moments of Rogue One... SO... was it a mistake showing R2D2 and C3P0 annoyed at being left behind at the rebel base?? Didn't R2 and C3P0 meet on Luke's planet after R2 escaped with the plans??? Continuity error???\n\nEdit 3: I see now this plot hole is well documented... problem with not being able to see a movie for the first two weeks of its release I guess!",

Characters getting killed off in an instant, the performance of Forest Whitaker definitely set the tone. The desperate gritty soldiers who voluntereed because they had sacrificed so much for the rebelliion.\n\n",

On the flip side; that's hard to do and not draw out the film too long but I feel like there's enough talented writers in Hollywood to help with this. \n\nAs an example I wanted to know way more about Saw. What does a rebel extremist do? Flesh that out! I need that!! Or Riz Ahmed's character- I want to know more about *why* he was so compelled to defect. I loved the characters just gimme a wee bit more! \n\nAlthough I will disagree and say there's actually blatant fan service many times over, but they did interweave other fan service into the film which was way cool.\n\nBottom line I loved it and it's good! ... just not quite great.

And Krennic would have been more involved in the ground level conflict and had a more dramatic death rather than the shot from Cassian. \n\nI'm really glad with what we ended up with, it seems like the previous cut of the film would have had Jyn surviving as she got off the planet with the physical tape rather than transmitting wirelessly.

Once they start dying you literally guess they all die and the movie does not try to surprise you which is a mistake.\n\nRemember in Saving Private Ryan some of the characters survive which actually adds A LOT to the plot (Upham goes from a coward to a \"redeeming\" himself).

Again trying to give people nostalgia boners too many times. The last 30 minutes of action seem like it blinded most people of the flaws of the movie.

It lacked the wanderlust of Ep.4 and the subtlty of Ep.5. \n\nI'd never thought I'd be bored of action in a Star Wars movie, but that's exactly what happened. Ignoring the final 2 minutes scene with Vader, which is probably one of my favourite Star Wars moments, the action felt overloaded, poorly paced and inconsequential. I didn't feel as if I cared about anyone in the movie enough, as if they were just dispensible for the sake of filling in the remaining holes of the 10-man-band, or whatever. \n\nI didn't think it was bad, by any means. It was kind of interesting in parts, pretty funny, Vader was a saving grace, K2 was a nice combo of Sheldon and Baymax, but I felt bored for the most part. I ask myself, what would I think of the movie had there been no Vader, and the answer is I probably would've disliked it. \n\nI hope Ep.8 and future Star Wars movies for that matter follow the guide of TFA rather than Rogue One. \n\nAlso, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I didn't hear any binary sunset or is that a Luke exclusive theme?\n",

I was thinking during my screening at about an hour into the movie if I would want to rewatch anything I had seen thus far and my answer was \"no\". Not that any of it was bad, but it felt very middle of the road and practical, as you said. This is the second movie I've seen in a month that just wasted Mads Mikkelsen. And the last thirty minutes was insanely entertaining, but it's a two and a half hour film. That's not a great ratio. I couldn't stand looking at Tarkin's face and the voice wasn't an impressive Peter Cushing impression. And how did they mess up Vader's voice so bad?\n\nOverall it's an alright movie, but could have been a lot more. As much as I defend Godzilla 2014, I do think Gareth Edwards has some issues with pacing and getting certain actors to really sell their lines. I'm ranking VII above this due to the great character work in that movie. This beat it in terms of visuals though ",

But that's also an overused cliche in Star Wars \"Randomly meet a stranger that turns out to be an old big timer\".\n\n>Never has creating a diversion to let someone climb up a chamber and grab a floppy disk been so overdramatized. The \"race against time\" theme is forced and unclimactic due to pacing concerns.\n\nI don't agree if you put it in context, if you count the stakes. They just realized the empire has a planet killer on their side and the rebellion is breaking up. This is literally the last chance they have for something they've been working on their entire lives. And how is the distraction weird? They wanted to draw out as many soldiers as possible, sound as big as possible, they wanted to seem much bigger than they were. I mean if Ryn wouldn't been able to get the info up to the ship then everything would've been lost. Their entire lives would've been for nothing.\n\nBut overall I guess I can't disagree with you. Main male character's accent and line delivery felt off point but he definitely grew on me and I loved the fact we finally get morally ambigious characters. Ryn felt also a bit off. I guess I mostly didn't like she got to deliver these long speeches. First of all her delivery wasn't that good and second of all she's just someone's daughter, who made her suddenly a leader. \n\nI didn't mind the references, I didn't feel like they were too much. I mean the c3po and r2d2 was just pointless. Like we've had them for pretty much every movie so far, they're in the same universe, I get it.\n\nI did get emotionally invested in the movie. Cassian definitely had me caring for his arch. Ryn was good enough. Mostly though I really felt like the war was real, like retrieving these plans were the only thing the rebellion had left. And while I didn't get perfect character development I felt like the characters were still pronounced enough for me to be able to imagine their stories. I got their ending, and their endings were great.  I mean especially if you compare these characters to the ones in TFA they're so much more alive. \n\nI felt like it was  a really good movie but mostly because the finish was so good. The pacing was definitely off in the beginning and I still feel like these new SW movies need to slow down and fucking breathe. TFA was definitely worse but this one wasn't perfect either. \n\n",

It was really lacking the spark and wit of the original Star Wars films (and to a certain extent The Force Awakens). The characters in this film tended to say things in the most direct, straightforward and unimaginative way possible (which I suppose does somewhat make sense, because these are ordinary soldiers rather than mystical space wizards). I feel there could have been much more expressive, clever and character-defining ways for information to have been conveyed. It was certainly well above the prequels (*I hate sand...*) but I did think it was pretty flat. There are very few lines in this film which I would call quotable or particularly memorable.",

All his work would be for nothing if no one did anything about the vulnerability he designed, and that seemed very much the case after that war council scene.\n\nShe was doing it less for the sake of the cause and more for her dad and mum, (who was a big believer in the force and hated knowing the Empire was stealing crystals from Jedi and using it for evil).",

            "body": "I agree. Felt the first hour or so, pretty much everything up until they became 'rogue one' was pretty bad. It felt like it had been interfered with. Scenes were short and choppy, character motivations were all over the place, the acting was bad, the writing was cheesy. The build up and quick dismissal of Forrest Whittaker's character was dissatisfying, Riz Ahmed getting tortured and 'losing his mind' for about ten seconds seemed pointless, Jyn's character 'not looking up' and then leading the argument for fighting at the rebel meeting seemed strange.\n\nThe only character I actually felt something for was the villain, everyone else left me feeling nothing for them. There was nowhere near enough time spent on developing any of them, especially in the first 20 minutes when it felt like every scene was about ten seconds long. Information overload, time jumps (what the hell had Jyn been up to since being a child?). The chaotic and jarring opening really hurt it for me, I didn't care about her seeing her Dad again, and of course he then immediately died, it felt so predictable.\n\nThe last hour or so though, that was where Gareth Edwards really showed his skills as a director. Fantastic action, huge scope for drama, it all worked. I still didn't care about the characters, but I was on the edge of my seat and the film seemed to step it up a notch in every unfolding scene. I think Edward's had the same problem in Godzilla, he doesn't seem very good at getting decent performances from his actors, and he had some brilliant actors to work with here. It's a shame, that first hour very nearly ruined the film for me. I'd watch it again, but would probably skip straight to the last act. ",

I mean, he already knew that the Deathstar was functional, that the information Galen had leaked was correct so far, Galens engineers were literally standing in line for an execution and he never wanted to kill Galen in the first place and was simply following orders from someone who's knowledge of the actual situation was limited. The death scene was really corny, though.\n\nWhat I did not like about the movie was the **obvious** radical mid-production change to Jins' character which undermined her whole character for the entire movie, since not all scenes were shot again, making her have a little \"schizophrenic\" acting in terms of how she felt about the rebellion. Krennec was also made a complete bitch, much unlike the charismatic villain he was in the trailers.\n\nStill, I give it a 8/10 because the space battle was simply the best in the entire saga and them actually having balls to kill off literally everybody. Vader really made \"less is more\" seem like an understatement, which was great refresh from the all sword duel bullshit from all the other films.\n\nThe hug scene which looked like the sun was rising in the horizon was also great, though I have absolutely no clue how they could have ended up in the beach in the first place when they were locked off and the tower topwas rather destroyed in the initial blast.",

He even left the U-Wing to follow Jyn. Jyn's character didn't care about any part of the narrative until she saw the message from her father. Only then, did she have any motivation to band together with these misfits. \n\nThere was a flow right up until that moment. Then, that flow falls apart for the next 30mins.  It picks up again during the 3rd Act. Good god, what a marvellous 3rd Act it was.\n\nGetting her father killed by the plot device of \u2018collateral damage\u2019 seemed like a cope out.

Because later on, after Krennic gets shot, we see him look up to see the Death Star, and he knows right there that the weapon he so badly wanted to be in control of is going to be the end of him. Vader isn't in his position because he wants power. He's in his position because of his \"religious\" beliefs and his want for vengeance.

Cassian too helped showed a darker, more dirtier side to the rebellion and his performance was exceptional imo. And he's not evil. He's a soldier who follows orders. The argument in the ship with Jyn after the attempt on her father illustrated his morality well. \n\n> Felicity Jones and Diego Luna lack charisma or charm as their characters, they're terribly bland compared to the rest of the cast\n\nFelicity's character is kind of meant to lack charisma and charm, especially at the beginning.

They introduced like six or seven new planets. But perhaps it was the rushed nature of how these were all revealed that made it feel small to you.\n\n> Firing the death star twice seemed to take the punch of the second time they did it, it'd only do it in the end and build it up more. In the movie, it feels like they're casually shooting womp rats in their T-16 instead of firing the most powerful weapon in the universe for the first time.\n\nThat's clearly intentional though. They went to great pains to show how trivial these targets were to these commanders/generals. It makes them seem even more cold, distant and evil that they so easily dispatch such large swathes of life (including their own forces). I do admit though it lost a bit of punch the second time they did it. But I mean, it's a movie about the death star. It seemed to go with out saying there would be so much gratuitous death star porn. I also love the scene where Krennic cuts off the guys calling out the targeting protocol jargon and just shouts something like \"just fire it!\".\n\n> I'd like to see more character building of Jyn and her father. Why not show some scenes from him \"inside the empire\" rather than just tell us about it? \n\nThere was actually a brief flashback of Jyn and her family during their Empire life though it only lasted like 10-20 seconds.

The way he was shot and the way the soundtrack always swelled when he was on the screen lead me to believe he was more important to the plot than he actually was. He is clearly an important figure to the people in the film, us as the audience just aren't really shown why.\n\n> The mindbending tentacles I could have lived without.

Fine whatever, but it fails at doing more than just showing the story happen anyway.  Her motivation is simple, Father is kidnapped, makes thing and wants to destroy it.  She gets involved as a McGuffin to push the story along and the watchers are supposed to follow her decide to join the rebellion.  \n\nProblem is we don't need that.  We know what is going on.  We don't need to watch her move from disinterested bystander to full on rebel.  We know why she would get involved, she doesn't need this huge attempted arc.  In the end this devotion to her doesn't really get anyone anywhere beyond where common sense would have put her if she just decided to help from the start.  Trying to show a transformation from this devil-may-care attitude into rebel operative serves no purpose.\n\nYou can compare her to the other characters who have a fraction, if any, of the character development.  Are they well thought out characters? No.  Do people understand why they are involved?  Yes.  The movie didn't need to spend over an hour getting people involved in them because they don't NEED a huge backstory and development.  Jyn didn't need a lot of this, but got it anyway and it doesn't move the character forward.  This is why it is an issue.  Simply having some crappy character arc for the sake of it makes the movie just plod along for the first hour while they try to beat you over the head with her motivation.  She doesn't need any of that.\n\nThe movie could be a \"simple\" spy action movie.  The second half of the movie works very well.  Partially because there isn't this massive focus on her, all of the characters are more or less given their tasks and do their jobs.  Once the focus because less on Jyn and more on the rebellion and it's purpose, the movie improves.  Once there is a clear objective the audience can focus on, the movie gets better.\n\nI really liked the second half, once the mission to the archives starts, the movie is very good.  The majority of the things before that are unnecessary to establish why the characters are getting involved.  The only reason people question why the fleet gets involved is because of this scene of them saying \"LOL WE AINT DOING SHIT\".  That is effectively the first half of the movie, having scenes in the movie just to have them but are completely unnecessary.",

Heck he has his own unit of death troopers who turn the tide of battle against the rebels on the beaches. He actually has some character unlike Hux who comes off has a Hitler Cartoon and makes me laugh.

Most of the gathering the ensemble phase was just okay to me (didn't help that the last trailer before the main event was Guardians of the Galaxy 2-- gathering the ensemble for the first one is still so damn entertaining). I didn't really link up with the family throughline for Jyn, either. \n\nOn the other hand, what won me over was more the overarching SW universe stuff. Slightly more of a show-don't-tell into how the Empire was administered and how the Death Star came about, proper scale for fighters vs. capital ships vs. Death Star, setting context for how fractured the Alliance was right before (and I guess kind of during) ANH because-- of course-- a gigantic superweapon was going to fuck up everything, etc. etc.",

Vader knew the plans were transmitted to the Tantive IV which was the whole reason they were trying to find the ship, and in the opening scroll of A New Hope it says that Leia is being pursued by Empire agents..  vader knew the \"diplomatic mission\" line was bullshit..\n\nVADER:  dont act so surprised your highness, you arent on any mercy mission this time. several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.. i want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. \n\nLEIA:  i dont know what youre talking about. im a member of the imperial senate on a diplomatic mission to alderran. \n\nVADER:  you are part of the rebel alliance, and a traitor! taker her away!\n\nnow... it seems in the movie they literally handed the plans to leia ( havent seen the movie but going off what ive heard so far ), but the plans were beamed from scarif to the larger rebel ship right? so technically that still holds..  Vader knew the whole time. Leia done fucked up if she thought she could get away with that\n",

Luke was the one to make the bombing run based on bullseyeing womp rats, dispite never having flown an X wing. \n\n\nChirrut is force sensitive, but untrained, similar to the way Leah can feel and sense the force. Combined with his daredevil hearing powers, he can sense the intentions of those around him. It was pretty clear a couple times like when he asks about Bodhi in the next cell, and when Cassian leaves to find Galen he asks Blaze if he looks like a killer and says \"The force is dark around one before they kill\"\n\n\nHe's also potentially [a Miraluka](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Miraluka) or at least his character is somewhat inspired by them. \n\n\nAlso I'm certain whatever Saw was breathing off wasnt exactly Oxygen, and on top of that he seemed to be viewed as a sort of senile old extremist. So hes just a bit coocoo in the coconuts I'm pretty sure. And I think he says \"tend to lose their minds\" as a threat but not a fact. I don't remember for sure though. \n\n\nAnd the Rogue One crew probably could have guessed they were working on the shield, but the plan to broadcast the plans was an audible, so being able to get in touch to let them know changed destroying the shields to priority 1 rather than staving off the imperial fleet\n\n\nThey don't explain it but these were AT-ACTs, the Cargo version of AT-ATs. So imagine the difference between a C-130 and an AC-130 in a combat scenario. Also the X-wings have more firepower than the retrofitted T-47 \"snowspeeders\" used on hoth, which are patrol ships. \n\n\n\"A larger version of the standard combat AT-AT, the AT-ACT walker features a dedicated cargo bed for the transportation of heavy building materials or combat munitions. It was deployed at major Imperial construction projects, such as shipyards and sprawling research installations.\"\n\n  ",

So really I think they should have started with something a little easier then the one where everyone dies! Because in my mind you have to stay true to your material.

It worked and was a nice wink to theoriginal.\n\nR2 and C3P0, fun cameo (and I think that they were aboard a different ship as you see 2 Rebellion ships of that size, one ariving after Raddus' ship), but THAT should have been cut or moved to the end aboard the Tantive IV. I'd argue that Tarkin's CGI was miles above Leia's - but I completely understand why it felt necessary and I'll explain but I'd like to point out something you're mistaken about:\n> Honestly, from a narrative standpoint, it would make much more sense if the movie ended after Jyn and Cassian died and the rebel plans get uploaded somewhere else. With all of our main characters dead and their mission complete, why should we really care about anything that happens after?\n\nThis is very wrong. From a narrative perspective, it's important to take time to show the new balance of the world after the main character's accomplish their mission - it's actually even more imperative to do so when they're all dead. In writing, this is called the denouement - we see them succeed, but we also see the Rebel fleet that came to scariff destroyed. If the film ended with them dying, someone jumping in with no prior knowledge without be wholly unsatisfied. The reason is because they've transmitted the plans, but we have no confirmation that the mission is a success especially because the Death Star is still standing: until we see the Princess and we get confirmation that the data is in the right hands. The rebels are in dire straights, but we're left with that hollwood hope trope of \"a better future\". This is something that all good movies rest heavily on and you can see it at work in films like Gladiator, even Star Wars",

I liked Cassian as a \"do what must be done\" type of rebel and really enjoyed Chirrut, who I originally didn't think would play out very well. Jyn was super bland. Krennic was an amazing villain, and I think he had the most believable and clear cut motivations and goals of anyone in the movie.\n\nI would have liked there to have been more character development and a bit slower pace on the introductions in the first act.  In a lot of the introductions and interactions with the characters they were whizzing though a lot of back story and didn't have much time to build up an emotional heart particularly between characters.\n\nI really like Cassian's character and was surprised and pleased by his motivations for following Jyn to Scarif.  I liked that he had a set of independent motivations centered on redeeming the darker acts of his past.  \n\nI was disappointed a bit with Chirrut.  I had heard rumors that he was the spiritual heart of the movie, but I felt we didn't get enough depth on this.  Most of his spiritual nature was simply communicated with his recitation of \"The Force is with me. I am one with the Force\" again and again.\n\nI really liked Jyn.  I was surprised by Jyn's action sequences which were solid and well done by Felicity Jones.  There were flashes of real heart and complexity to her character, but so little time to spend on it that I came away wanting much more.\n\nKrennic I was a bit disappointed in.  Ben's performance was great, but the interaction with Vader felt a bit forced and weak.  All his stuff with Galen though, I thought was among the strongest moments of character interaction in the film.\n\nIt would have liked the film to be 30 minutes longer at the beginning to give a slower pace and more time to building relationships, but I know with a two hour running time, they were keen to stuff in all the action, which was fun and seems like it was really especially fan pleasing.",

Anyone who has not seen A New Hope loses nothing from this being here.\n\nThis one was actually the only moment that felt too \"fan-servicey\" for me. I didn't really see the point. It didn't add any information to the film (first time viewers would have no idea who they are) and it pulled me, a huge fan, out of the film. It was on-par with the deleted Anakin/Greedo scene from Phantom Menace.\n\n>Bail and Mon Mothma talking about Obi Wan - This should have been cut and does nothing but confuse casual viewers. All the fanboys get to go \"HELL YES, he's talking about Obi Wan!\" but anyone else would be so taken out of the movie and confused.\n\nThis worked because it gives some context to Leia's mission if you simply roll into the next film, and if you are coming into this after seeing Revenge of the Sith, it serves as connective tissue. Bail knows Leia is Vader's child. And he's sending her to a Jedi Master. It's isn't really only about the plans.\n\n>R2D2 and C3PO - Also should have been cut, pretty much for the same reason as above. I guess most people would recognize them as the droids from the other movies, but that doesn't necessarily mean they need to appear.\n\nThis was the second fan-service moment that struck me as superfluous.\n\n>HOW THE FUCK DID R2 and 3PO GET ON THE TANTIVE IV? I may be getting confused on the ships that were in the battle, but it seemed like the rebel flagship was Admiral Raddus' ship, no? This same ship was, to my understanding, the one that had gone off to fight and inspired the rebel fighters to go join them, and if you remember, R2 and 3PO were on Yavin IV at that point commenting on all the fighters heading that way.\n\nI saw it like this. First, we know that 3PO and R2 serve on the Tantive IV as they were assigned their to work under Captain Antilles at the end of Revenge of the Sith. It's their ship.\n\nSo as the fighters are leaving, I had just assumed that the flagship attached to the Tantive hadn't taken off just yet. They load them all up on the ship and take off.

AOTC\n\nRogue One felt like the closest to a \"mature\" star wars film that covered new ground in a long time.  I think the space battles are also the most coherent space battles we have ever seen in star wars films except maybe ANH.  Understandable or innovative tactics being employed rather than the bullet hell of ROTJ or TPM. \n\nHowever, what holds it back is a lack of anticipation.  Things are happening at a fast pace with little forewarning, so you rarely get the anticipation of Oceans 11 or even ANH.  It lacks the classic dialogue and worldbuilding of TESB, and has a few too many characters who aren't explored adequately.  \n\nHowever, I am glad they were able to write a strong, independent female lead that wasn't a Mary Sue, no explicit Jedi, but still had elements of the Force.

Why was the plan to kill Galen Erso from a secret sniper on a hilltop, hoping he would be outside, instead of just bombing the facility in the first place? Why did they want to kill him in the first place - could no one else in the galaxy have done what he did?\n\nWhy does everyone care about the defective pilot so much? It seems nigh impossible to keep the death Star a secret, with around a 500 million to a billion  (someone did the math) people in direct involvement. Darth Vader doesn't have better things to worry about? \n\nFinally, HOW DID CASSIAN CLIMB INJURED UP THE WHOLE FACILITY, THROUGH THE OPENING AND SHUTTING TRAP DOOR, AND OUT TO THE TOP while and arrive right after Orson Krennic, who took the elevator? \n\nSorry, I tend to nitpick.

But together with a small group of equally \"helpless\" individuals he helped cause a massive defeat for the Empire, and on top of that watched his blind friend walk across a battlefield protected only be his faith in force, and thus by the end found his own faith restored.\n\nJyn Erso was a damaged woman who cared only about herself, because everyone she ever loved or trusted abandoned her. When the Rebellion asked for her help she provided it only because they gave her no choice- despite everything the Empire had done to her, she just didn't see the point in fighting against them. But discovering her Father had never abandoned her in his heart and that Saw truly thought he was doing what was best for her, she realised that she could actually matter and make a difference, and convinced others to do the same.\n\nSo when you say there's no character development, I've got to ask- what fucking film did you go to see?",

Second, is film resolution. Films are much clearer than movie in the seventies, eighties, and even the nineties. The reason that everyone thinks that the CGI in the Original Jurassic Park is so much better than the CGI in Jurassic World (hint, in some ways it is, but in most ways it's not), is that the animators have to match the cinematography to the CGI at high resolution. Jurassic Park worked because I has a painted look from the film stock that leaves much to the imagination to fill in. Third, CGI has become too animated. Peter Cushing knew and understood that being semi emotionless was, in fact displaying an emotion. Showing no facial expression informs us as an audience about a character's motivations. IMHO ",

And frankly, a plot hole that tiny shouldn't take you out of a movie from a franchise that has never been about airtight plots.\n\nThere was plenty of humor, but there were also plenty of scenes that were completely serious.  There was very little humor in the entire third act, to be honest.\n\nThose were the only two points I really wanted to respond to, since the rest is pretty much entirely subjective.  I didn't find the acting to be wooden, and I thought Orson Krennic was a fine villain.\n\nI will agree that that Vader line was cheesy as hell, though.

He's been dropping force choke one liners as long as he's been around.\n\nR2-D2 and C3P0 are on Yavin, the rebel flagship launches from Yavin, Leia's ship is docked to that ship.  So no plot hole there, dingus.  They would have definitely been on Yavin.  The only plot hole is when in New Hope, the captain of Leia's ship tries to convince Vader they are on a diplomatic mission, when Vader personally saw that ship fleeing the battle with the plans and everyone on that ship knew it.  However, the ship capture we see at the beginning of A New Hope might be weeks later for all we know.  So still fine.\n\nThe acting was fine. You probably didn't like the opening scene because you couldn't get over the lack of an opening crawl.  \n\nThe villain was needed to drive the Empire's actions during the movie but not survive to the trilogy.  If Tarkin was the main bad guy he would've been flogged and stripped of command for letting the plans get out.  Just because he kept getting foiled, didn't make him useless.  Most villains gets foiled at every turn.\n\nThere's always humor in tense moments in all but the darkest scenes in every star wars film.  So that's a strange complaint coming from a fan.\n\nDo you have any other complaints other than maybe, the CGI uncanny valley dwelling, tech-demo looking ressuractors?",

TFA managed to keep the score true to the originals and add many new scores that all adhered to the set style. This discomfort culminated for me in the final space battle which i was super happy to see but it did not feel right at all with the score so far off the mark. TLDR John Williams is the Man.\n\n\nPoint 2 speaks for itself, you think that they would remember the wound in all our minds that was the end of Revenge of the Sith. Showing Leia back turned as if your going to hint at her being there only to have her turn to camera anyway was inexplicable and unnecessary. The scene with Lord Vader just before the end is a matter for a whole other debate, for my augment lets assume you left that where it was. Let Lord Vader do his thing , airlock closes Corvette drops, long pan around at the ships then back to the font facing camera and jump to hyperspace CREDITS would have been fine.\n",

            "body": "I agree with you on Darth Vader, he seemed like an afterthought. But you gotta admit that ending scene with him was awesome as fuck. My problem with Force Awakens was because it just relied on the fact that a fuckton of people had watched Star Wars and would get all the \"in your face\" references.\n\nAnother important thing that you highlighted, the human side of the struggle. There are people in the Star Wars galaxy other than the Jedi, Sith and the Skywalkers, why not concentrate on them a bit ? I got shit on for talking about this when TFA was released, really glad with the direction they took in this film.  One of the things that I didn't expect was that the camera work was spectacular at times although it was pretty generic throughout. I also felt that the editing was a little lacklustre in the first act, the scenes ended a little too abruptly and the flow was disturbed quite a lot of times, but by the second half as the pace picked up, it improved.\n\nThe whole movie felt a little darker than any other Star Wars movie, perhaps because there were no force shenanigans eclipsing everything else that was happening onscreen. \n\n\n\n\n",

Despite being half cyborg, Anakin is still a force to be reckon with and why he's feared by all. \n\nIronically, I've never seen how menacing Vader can be until recent times with [Star Wars Rebels(man, the part where he forces someone decapitate himself...)](https://youtu.be/c-jQL-0oxTA), [Vader Down](http://i.imgur.com/nwqldjv.jpg), and this movie.

For that last scene I think it completely reinforces the story that is being told. Throughout the film hope is the key driving factor. They all know that they are going to die, that is the key change for Jyn she goes from simply surviving to wanting to do something. They do it for something greater for hope. Vader in that scene is a physical manifestation of the terror an power of the Empire. Yet the rebels did not cower in fear they fought on. That is supremely important for that scene. As cool as it is to see Vader wrecking shop, what hit me in that scene is that even though they are terrified, screaming, dying in pain, they keep moving the death star plans away from Vader. They keep hope alive. That was what Rogue One did and that scene is really important. ",

            "body": "It's definitely better than the Force Awakens, but no where near as good as IV, VI and especially V.\n\nThis movie confirmed a major issue with Garret Edwards as a director for me. He has an incredibly difficult time balancing major set pieces with character development. In Monsters, he gives the first hour of the movie to literally just developing the characters, and it was great because it allowed the audience to develop an affinity for the characters for when the shit hit the fan.\n\nBut in both Godzilla and Rogue One, when Edwards doesn't have the luxury of spending that time with his characters, we lose out on that connection to the characters. It's also significantly more evident in Rogue One, which has such a large cast. Jyn had the potential to be an amazing character, but we needed to spend more time with her as an adult to get there. Doing the flash back was an incredibly poor decision and was almost definitely written to get Mads Mikkelsen more screen time.\n\nBecause of the number of characters and the truncated relationships, we end up with a lot of telling vs. showing, which is a similar problem that Lucas had in the prequels. Telling is good when it forms part of our characters. Obi-Wan telling Luke about the Jedi and his father is an iconic and incredible scene because you can see Luke's ambitions developing and deepening even further. Rogue One came so close to achieving a scene like this with Galen's hologram message to Jyn, but because we hadn't spent enough time with either Jyn or Galen due to the fracturing of the narrative, the emotional impact is diminished severely and thus diminishes how convincing her motivations are to join the rebellion.\n\nI also think it was a big mistake to address the gray areas of war in the Star Wars cinematic universe. That's fine for a long-form narrative like television or video games (KOTOR II for instance), but the Star Wars cinematic universe is a story that's fundamentally about good vs. evil, it's so on-the-nose that there is a Light Side and Dark Side of the force. Straying too far away from that formula diminishes the tension of the film and comes off as a little pretentious when you don't have the time to explore those ideas in a long form narrative. That's not to say these are bad ideas, it just would've worked much better in a Rogue One television show where we had time to explore these characters, their relationships, their histories and their motivations in-depth, so that we as an audience actually give a shit when they're debating the minutiae of the morality of war.\n\nThat being said, I don't think Jyn was as bad a character as people are claiming. Felicity Jones also gave a great performance, that with better writing, could have become a character that could've stood next to any other character in the original films. Cassian's performance was also good, despite his, at times, hard to understand accent, but he also suffered from being underwritten and not having enough screen time. Chirrut, as a blind quasi-force-sensitive monk, was an interesting character and - despite being obvious pandering to the Chinese market - was a breakout character that could have been fantastic with again, more time and better writing.\n\nKrennic was a great villain whom I would argue actually had the clearest motivation of any character in the film. Every action he took made complete sense for his character and he had an absolutely fitting end. That was great movie character writing and I wish that the other characters in the film had that approach.\n\nVader was utilized exceptionally well. Aside from his cringe-worthy pun and weird costume redesign, everything else was spectacular. His \"home\", the tank, his entourage, his entrance, etc. were all great. The scene in the rebel ship where he actually fights was perfect. That was exactly how a lightsaber should be used in Star Wars. It should only be used in a moment of extreme motivation (kill the rebels) and clear stakes (recover the plans).\n\nAll that aside, I thought this was the first Disney Star Wars, and the first Star Wars anything, since episode VI that actually felt like it took place in the Star Wars universe. The world and set design, aside from a few moments of overt CGI usage (such as the fly-in to the asteroid city) all felt like the same Universe as IV, V and VI. The Empire-inspired portions specifically *actually felt like the Empire*.\n\nFinally, K-2SO felt like an actual Star Wars character. He could have actually been in IV, V and VI. Period. His writing, Alan Tudyk's performance, his character design, everything was perfectly Star Wars.",

Also in interstellar space rogue planets, brown dwarfs, black holes, and un-mapped systems could be lurking. So people stick to mapped out space lanes that are known to be clear of other objects.

It's a straight up war mission movie and the enemy is the nazis and high likelihood of not going home at the end. ",

Or maybe a nightmare where something awful chases you and it seems like no matter how hard you try you can't run, so you wake up in a cold sweat? It felt like that to me. Just a pants-shittingly horrific threat that absolutely can't be defeated, and you know the moment you see it that it's already too late. Every single one of those rebels knew they were dead the moment that saber lit up, and the scene was constructed so well that *we* could palpably feel that tension just before witnessing the unrelenting slaughter. \n\nHis swordsmanship was faster and more fluid than the original trilogy but not full of needless flourish like the prequels. He didn't laugh maniacally or pause for fun overkill. He took all of their lives, brutally and efficiently, purely because they were between him and his goal. And a villain that kills with both impossible skill and flat disregard for life is way more menacing than a villain that's flamboyantly malicious. He was essentially the ultimate realization of the dark side: an unfeeling storm of incomprehensible power. And, in that sense, he mirrored the blast approaching Jyn and Cassian. Steady and inevitable doom.\n\nTl;dr: for the first time, Darth Vader scared the shit out of me\n\n ",

Movie had a lot of that. The ship from the current Rebels cartoon appears in the final battle, and one of the characters gets called over the loudspeaker on Yavin. I was okay with them.\n\nWouldn't surprise me if the Vader's House scene was forced by Disney. It felt cobbled together, and it certainly wasn't necessary to the story, for example. Makes you wonder what could have fit in that 5 minutes.\n\nAnd dammit, what happened to all of Saw's partisans?  They're fleeing the building at the same time as the protagonists, and then they all disappear, lol.

As you suggest, I think taking out a few of the \"go here to get here\" moments and simplifying would create more room for character scenes.\n\nI'd have liked a little more with the two main characters, Jin and Saw background (rather than just a line of backstory), Jin and her dad, etc... \n\nMake Jin a more interesting character. In some ways, it felt like she didn't serve much of a purpose. What was her skillset? Showing that early (and why she was imprisoned) might have helped.\n\nMore with Cassian's struggles. He had an okay arc, but it seemed to be missing elements and perhaps an iconic scene. Considering the overall darker tone of the movie, I think it would have been worthwhile to have Cassian kill Jin's dad. That could have been the catalyst that made him question his life, would have created more interesting tension between Jin/Cassian, and could have led to more development.\n\nIn fact, actually, if I was writing it, I'd probably cut Jin's dad out completely. Though I didn't hate his role, it didn't add much of anything to the story. If anything, it took away a chance to better develop other characters. It would also allow for a more simplified plot. You'd end up taking out the entire arc at the research facility, but I honestly don't know what that part brought to the story anyway.\n\nI'm rambling. Good breakdown as it got me thinking.",

But it almost felt like 80% of the minor cast was acted super poorly. So when the mother in the very beginning had some bad lines, that took me out of the experience. When the strange cameos or little quips from background characters came around and were poorly done, that took me out. When random shouts in the Rebel Alliance meeting were half-assed in their delivery, that took me out. When Darth Vader dadjoked Ben Mendelsohn's character, and with peculiar execution, that took me out.\n\nIt's the little things.",

Not everything has to drive the story.  \n\nSecondly, its not even like it was a stretch for him to be there. He is the right hand of the Emperor, and it was established about 30 years ago that he has a direct interest in these events. Him being there makes perfect sense, and it was entertaining. Like he only had a few minutes, it wasn't even over done  \n\nEdit; Just something I've observed, but comments from people who knew Tarkins actor was deceased seemed to think the CGI was obvious, but those that didn't find out until after seem to think it was really good. So maybe being aware that it was CGI as you are viewing is making a difference. Im going with a friend tomorrow who I know doesn't know about him, so i'll see what he thinks of it",

Because fuck the Empire!\n\nThey don't use lightsabers, and they don't have a useful understanding of the force, but they do have blasters, stealth, trickery, and explosions. \n\nAccordingly, this film wouldn't be a big space opera with a huge space battle at the end -- this is the story of a smaller group of badasses doing badass stuff. You can even look to a heist film like *Ocean's Eleven* for some inspiration, although you'd want the tone to be more serious. Point being, you want your characters to have character. You want viewers to really feel something when they're in danger and when they die. \n\nReasonable people can disagree on all of that though, and regardless of what direction the film should have gone, it was clear to me that the story people never really drilled down on it. They wanted a film that could be all things to all people -- and based on most people's reactions, it seems they were largely successful.

Just keep it simple, keep it character focused, then you can let those themes shine. But again, I'm a 22 year old on Reddit, I don't make millions of dollars on movies so my opinion is whatever. I really liked the movie though, probably as much as TFA. We still haven't reached OG trilogy great yet though, and I thought this film had a better shot than TFA at doing so. ",

(Maybe a \"you're no better than the empire\" sorta scene.) Then you have her go off to do this mission to find her dad, more shady shit happens with the Rebel team she's with, but then we see the Empire destroy the city, killing most of her team/leaving her with a new cast of characters (sort of like we have in the film) and she sees their destruction, maybe Rebel boy saves her life and dies or something, and she's convinced to fight the Imperial Army, not for the Rebellion but for her friends. Something like that. Anything to make me care about her motivations. Then she finds her dad, the Rebels order her to kill him and take the plans (maybe he physically has them, not this weird archive shit) and he willingly gives them to her and explains the whole \"I placed a trap in it\" deal, then maybe Vader gets wind of the Rebels breaking into a base, and she's able to just get away but the rest of her team dies fighting him to protect her. She's kind of on her own now because she had to make a last minute escape, but she's picked up by a passing rebel ship with a certain Leia Organa on it...as she's presumably on her way to get Ben. \n\nANYTHING to make me care about Jyn.

You see an object or recognize a plot point that recalls the former film.\n\nIn Rogue One, it was a lot more, \"Hey, remember X?!\" And sometimes, it worked. Vader and Tarkin in the film made perfect sense. As did Bail Organa, Gold and Red Leaders, and to some degree the use of Mustafar.\n\nBut the cantina dudes?

You are shown that she has never forgotten her parents and will go to any lengths to honor them. If you think about it, in a way, she really isn't doing it for politics at all. She is fighting to reclaim something she lost. It certainly becomes political but I'm talking about potential subconscious motivators that drive her actions.

The only point that I disagree with is on Rook - I don't really think we got enough there. His arc of being a defector moved the story along and I'm not necessarily saying we need TONS of development but a few lines of dialogue or a scene to just say why he was specifically chosen or sent to pass along Galen Erso's message would've been nice (something similar to the outburst that Cassian has towards Jyn about how long he's been rebelling and how she's not the only one that's lost something).

It's clear to me he only exists because they couldn't keep up the CGI on Tarkin for the whole film. It barely held up in the scenes he was in, uncanny valley to the extreme. So, they added in Krennic to act as mini Tarkin.\n\nSimple fix: Have Tarkin control the Death Troopers remotely, via hologram. Do that, and the film plays out exactly the same way. You've just removed an entire character from the film, and with one tiny change made everything happen in the exact same way.\n\nThat's a problem. No main antagonist should be so unimportant to the plot. \n\nWhether you find Hux cartoonish or not, he was in charge of that battle station. You can't remove his character. He leads the new empire, and he controls that station. He's an essential character to that story as they told it. ",

And even still, if she HAS to go, three of the rebels could have easily put on the armor of the stormtroopers who came in with the inspector and gone with Cassian and Jyn.\n\nLeia also has strong family ties to force users to explain this. Chirrut is basically mocked for believing in the force and notions that he is a Jedi. I agree that he seemed to definitely be force sensitive, but the film should have fleshed that out way more. And I was more talking about the consistency of his abilities. Like at the end of the movie where he is guided directly to the control panel, but then has to feel around for the switch. \n\nRegardless of what drugs Saw was on, the movie created an issue of Bodhi losing his mind. And then resolved that issue by asking him like one question. \n\nKind of going back to previous point, the movie created this big issue of having AT-ATs come into the battle and we the viewer know from previous films just how strong and tough they are. Then they are destroyed in a matter of seconds by background characters. \n\nYour last point makes a good point. \n\n",

The core trilogies have to follow an overall arc and keep to somewhat the same feel for the sake of continuity, but since the spin offs are meant to be more independent they can only benefit from a wider variety of archetypes.  Rogue One was the most combat-oriented of all the Star Wars movies to date, and I've heard the Han Solo spin off for 2019 is going to be a western.\n\nHopefully this trend continues.  Just because the Star Wars roots are fantasy/adventure/action/sci-fi, doesn't mean they all have to be like that.  Not every Star Wars movie has to appeal to the same crowd, and it might even bring in even more fans by occasionally branching into other genres.  I know people like to make fun of the prequels for their sometimes dense and confusing political plots, but shows like House of Cards, The West Wing, and even Game of Thrones prove that political dramas can be very successful.  I'd personally love to see a Star Wars political drama set either in the Old Republic era well before the prequels, or in the very early days of the Empire, immediately after Ep. III.",

I know people liked the scene but it's like Rey selling BB8 or the orc from the Hobbit killing Legolas in the third film. Certain events just can't happen or you create problems for yourself. And with film, you can't always just ask for another 10 minutes to fix this corner you just wrote yourself into.\n\nThat said, you've got Vader pegged all wrong. People don't fear him for what he does to the Rebels, they fear him because he kills every officer next to him for the slightest failure. It's a toxic work environment because promotions are forced on people and act as a guaranteed death sentence. There's no room for growth or learning from mistakes, just one slip up and suddenly you're three feet off the ground unable to breath. The upper echelon of his officers are either people who are actually competent or are sociopathically adept at shifting blame away from themselves.",

When he got more information, he realized he needed to send in the squadron of X-Wings.",

We see them blasting off and my presumption is that boom...now we're into Episode IV. Why would the Captain of the corvette even bother trying to convince Vader that it's a Counselor ship when he JUST saw them blasting out of the shuttle bay?   \n\u2022 Their reaction to the Death Star plans being a \"Myth\" and the whole council sceen was ludicrous to me. Rebel intelligence sends out a man that heard a rumor of a pilot that may have worked directly with the architect of the Death Star...but won't give the time of day to Jyn's report?   \n\u2022 Why was there such a pronounced emphasis on Kyber Crystals and the Force from Jyn's mom. There was no follow-up to that other than, \"the super laser uses Kyber Crystals as its power source\".    \n\u2022 How is it the Rebellion found Jyn before the empire? Yes, I suppose you could write it off to \"well, the empire didn't care about her anymore.\" But It doesn't strike me as completely valid with the Orson's personality. This was a man that would use you, lie to you and do what he had to do to manipulate and provoke you to doing what needs to be done. Zero Fs given. Daughter is supreme leverage if Galen ever \"misbehaves\". Why give that up? It just didn't work for me.     \nThere was more, just gets too long.    \n    \n>Vader's pun was completely within character    \n   \nI'll have to disagree with you there. In the past movies, he was more witty. This was a \"dad joke\" delivery to me (and Luke wasn't there to hear it). But, understand, IV, V, and VI are what I grew up with. I will agree that, yes, I, II, & III he's a little more blunt with the puns, but to me that was Anakin, not Darth Vader.   \n     \nOh, no. The cameo didn't *ruin* THIS movie for me, but yes...it is definitely a pet peeve. They're getting out of hand and have ruined previous SW movies for me without a doubt.   \n    \nThe crawl made sense after another redditor pointed out that it was intentional. And as I stated there, cool. That's fine. But man...come up with a better opening sequence than what they did.   \n    \nAH! now that I'm discussing this I just figured out what it kind of reminds me of. All the showing of the planet names, shifts and other elements, it actually reminds me of the new Star Trek movies. Huh. ",

I'm just speaking from experience because the people I saw it with weren't able to keep up a conversation about it with me because they didn't care enough to notice the stuff I did. I'm not 100% objectively correct and I'm open to being proven wrong about stuff but if noticing a film's negatives and complaining about them on the internet makes me an arrogant asshole, then that's fine. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

            "body": "Fair question and I will give you several reasons why (these are just off the top of my head):  \n\n* Harrison Ford and Carrie Fischer phoned in their performances.  In fact, I would say Disney made a huge mistake including them in this film.  I don't even know why Harrison Ford wanted to do the film or why he acts anymore.  In every movie as of late, he's just going through the motions.  I feel like ever since he started wearing an earring, he become a horrible actor :)  End of rant on Harrison Ford.\n\n* The escape scene with Jon Boyega/Oscaar Isaacs seemed way too rushed and lazy.\n\n* Scene where Chewie, Han, John Boyega land on some cliff and then just stroll down to the death star entrance was comical.\n\n* The scene where they find the millenium falcon seemed way too convenient.  The pirate scene was way too CGI-ish/Cartoonish.\n\n*  During the build up to the movie, I remember Disney/Abrams saying they were going to use ship models like the originals as opposed to heavy CGI.  Not sure if this was a marketing ploy since everyone had a bad taste in their mouth with Jar Jar Binks and Lucas' meddling with the originals, but it seemed to me that there was still a ton of CGI in the ship scenes but I'm no expert.\n\n* I just couldn't get into Adam Driver's character at all.  Nothing seemed menacing about him.  The whole mask thing was stupid.  Not sure if this was just bad writing or bad casting or both.  Needed someone more along the lines of Hayden Christensen in episode 3.\n\n* I feel like they really missed the mark on the last scene with Rey/Luke.  I don't know if it's because they did too much panning with the camera or the duration, but it just seemed corny how she was standing there for what seemed like forever holding his light saber.\n\nEnd result is I think the movie was targeted towards millenials, and I noticed in the theatre it was mostly millenials clapping at the end.

Now as for things I saw coming... Blind \"wise man\" sitting in corner who has a stick. Obviously he's going to show up at some critical moment and wow everyone with his stick skills and belief that the universe/force protects him. It's not a new idea for a character. Conflict between the fiery protagonist and what the rebellion wants? Predictable. Father gets taken away early in the movie? Definitely going to die later on and Jyn is going to see. Main antagonist thwarted at every turn and dies when he seems so close to victory? And by a guy who really shouldn't be able to even be there? At just the perfect moment so they can push an awkward romantic connection? Yeah, seen it. The list goes on. \n\nI was also pretty bothered about how inept they made the Empire be. Like I get of course they're going to make them have some shortcomings so that the underdogs can be the heroes but dear god it was hard to watch. It was basically bowling pins vs CS:GO aimbots. Those star destroyers should have easily been able to take out that rebel fleet. And why did the Empire never send out their fighters until was later? It was kind of like everybody was just standing around not knowing what to do. The only thing that made me feel better was Vader's appearance and subsequent slaughter of anybody in his way. I could watch that all day.

You're right that if you go that far back with someone even in a non-romantic way, the reaction to losing them would likely be pretty much the same. Either way, I thought it was a very good scene. I kind of liked that they didn't go full Hollywood after that and have his friend go HAM and just absolutely wreck a whole bunch of troopers in this fit of rage and sadness. While he did have that reaction and got to die the hero's death, the fact was only able to take out relatively few Imperials before being killed himself was, I thought, one of many ways that the movie effectively underscores the desperation of the whole Rebel movement.

One commands a much higher wage than the other.  Also, if you wanted a SuperHero movie, Gary would be an odd choice.\n\nBut if you are choosing the facial actor who did Gollum vs the second-best facial actor?  There's no household awareness of those actors.  They are also more interchangable -- you can use a fat guy in his 60s (in theory).  \n\nAlso, while animators need to be paid, real actors also need a lot of support staff -- hair / makeup / props, or you end up having to splice the visual effects on top of the actor anyways.\n\nI think there will definitely be a transition phase, and there will ALWAYS be some movies made with human actors.  But I think studios will start developing \"virtual talent\".  \n\nIn Japan this is already happening somewhat -- they have purely digital idols that generate a lot of interest.  People even pay to go see a concert by the digital idol.  Japan is a little odd, but sometimes they run ahead of the pack in weird ways (smartphones).",

It woulda made a great combination of attitudes to the suicide mission, rebels being \"for the cause\" and Jin being just angry and not caring about anything than avenging her dad.

Jyn and Cassian make it to the tower almost instantaneously, and the rest of the team doesn't really get much time to do stuff before they die.  I'd have preferred that they stuck together for longer during the battle, and didn't all sort of die at once, but rather spread throughout a longer period of time (again, like Reach).  ",

Maybe Krennic himself was not terribly essential in the movie, but I think having that level of character was brilliant in building the universe.\n\nIt helps show the vastness of the military regime that is the Empire. Tarkin is a head honcho on the Death Star, but he's not an engineer. He is there to command the power of it, not build it. Vader comes in when needed because he's the sword of the Emperor.\n\nNot every little detail and roadblock of the construction of this nightmare battlestation can be handled by Tarkin. So, of course there's a Krennic: scary and evil in his own right, has the knowledge/connections to complete the weaponry, but is ultimately small, not respected, ambitious and petty. And while he (and perhaps hundreds of other Empire commanders at his rank) has ruined lives, he is ultimately swept aside by the the weapon he helped build. Because the Empire gives no shits about him, whatever his ambition.\n\nI don't think I explained myself very well. But having a \"lower level\" bad guy, who arguably is not essential to the story, really gave an impression of the breadth and size of the Empire machine to me. It was the same on the rebel side: our \"heroes\" died. The war moves on. The whole movie was about smaller actors, all of the little pieces that build up to the huge forces of the Empire and the Alliance. \n\nBasically, if this whole movie depended on Tarkin and Vader to be the main antagonists, I would have thought \"Jeezus, are there only like 3 guys in the Empire that ever *do* anything???\" So in that way, I loved Krennic.",

Tarkin I liked a lot, but Vader's first scene was super meh (and the dad joke?! I mean, dad jokes are my favorite but why is Vader saying them?!). R2 and 3PO was strange because they *weren't on the ship they were seen on in ANH.* It seemed like the fleet went off before they showed R2 and 3PO still on Yavin.\n\nThere were other callbacks that were super jarring though. Doesn't Saw say at one point in the similar tone of voice \"It's a trap!\" just out of nowhere? One of Gold Squadron says the line \"Watch out for those towers!\" in the exact same tone of voice as the original line in ANH (which felt really forced and unnecessary).

He also doesn't back down from Jyn's sudden awakening and thinking she owns what it means to be a rebel. Both of them are semi-complex characters that could have used further development but are constrained by the fac that this is a big budget Star Wars movie that needs to have explosions and action. Heck tons of people are complaining about the first act being slow in this when I thought it played like gangbusters and could have been a bit slower. ",

One possible example, though, is when she saved herself from captivity. She all of a sudden could use force mind powers. That was only after being reached out to by the Force (/possibly Obi Wan). The rest were fairly feasible. She beat Ren only after he'd fought with Finn, and was shot by Chewbacca. She had help, and again, seems to be very force attuned. \n\nedit: and to me, you look like an idiot attributing Rey's character/development as a \"fear of sexism\" in the writers.

I'm sure any director would be happy to do reshoots to improve their own vision of the film but historically they don't typically get that opportunity.\n\nSame thing happens with Mad Max where the studio saw the film and understood that giving the director more resources could take it from good to great.",

The diplomatic mission she claimed was to Alderaan, and thus she had no reason to be at Tatooine. \n\nIt's just that her lie has some sort of cover, since she's a Senator and her home planet is Alderaan. \n\nBut, when your ship just escaped from a battle, on the side of the Rebels, your lie is pretty flimsy. \n\nIt's even worse when you realize that Darth Vader doesn't even call her on it. His line to her was:\n\n>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.\n\nWhich is *technically* true, I guess, even though they weren't beamed to that ship, they were carried on, and he *personally* watched her ship escape the battle from inside the hangar.\n\nTheir entire conversation from A New Hope is carried out with the understanding that she is still, from all appearances, a legitimate Senator and that her ship hiding the plans was not a Hail Mary to escape with them, but instead an attempt to cleverly hide the plans on what should be a legitimate voyage. This is just basic spycraft. If you have an agent with diplomatic cover and immunity, you don't send her personal space ship to the overt battle with your enemy, lol.\n\nIt kinda ruins her diplomatic cover.",

Gerrera's death was dumb and meaningless to the plot, same with Jyn's father (he has like 10 minutes of screen time and then they try to turn his death into some big thing as if he actually matters to the audience). After two character deaths which meant nothing, each subsequent character death suffers because you can clearly see that they're trying to bring emotion into a completely emotionless movie. K2 and Imwe were good characters, but by the time Imwe dies we've already seen half the cast die, so it means nothing. I just felt like Disney was punching me in the face with boxing gloves that read \"BE SAD NOW LOOK PEOPLE YOU'VE SPENT 2 HOURS WITH ARE DYING\" and it felt super contrived. I've cried to movies. This movie felt soulless. \n\nI do agree that Han's death in FA was lazy and definitely just thrown in for the \"Oh no big character death!\" factor, but at least it had some sort of gravity. It was important to Kylo Ren's development. \n\nReally? You think Poe was worse than Jyn? I disagree, but Poe also isn't the protagonist of TFA. Jyn is supposed to carry the movie but she has no personality, no particular talents, and no goals or ambitions. She's just completely hollow. \n\nI'm not saying Force Awakens was great by any means, but Rogue One is the only movie this year that I debated walking out of. Glad I didn't, though.

Every major character of TFA--Rey, Poe, Kylo, and Finn stood out to me, had some really strong development and felt super memorable. That's the problem with Rogue One's cast--most of them just don't leave a mark. For example, what's the name of that imperial pilot? How about the name of the heavy weapons guy? Or Donnie Yen's character? Or the droid? Even Donnie Yen's character and the droid who were my favorite characters couldn't even get most of the audience to remember their names, and now we refer to them as just that.\n\nAlso, the point about Rey being overpowered is highly debatable (mostly because half the movie is her backing out of stuff, and getting captured, and losing fights, so just because she wins two or three fights and already is a pilot doesn't make her OP), but Poe was definitely not a non-factor.\n\nAlso, **you're not even responding to the post you're replying to**. My post was about the bad acting in the minor and backdrop casts. Why are we even going off-topic here?",

Standard procedure in diplomatic incidents is to contact the respective governments and try to figure things out from there.

Instead she's saying she may have been with the battle fleet but not as a combatant but as a diplomat.\n\n> It was a pretty slim chance but what's she got to lose by trying?\n\nShe may have hoped that Alderaan had enough political leverage with the Empire to hopefully have them honor diplomatic procedures.

The pilots goal is to tell them to open the gate when they had already been trying? Guess they'll try harder now.). And most of all, I'm kinda just over big cg star battles.

So after the first viewing of TFA I knew every character's name super clearly. Yet after watching Rogue One, despite Donnie Yen's character and the droid being easily my two favorites, I still don't know their names. Hell, I've only heard a few people on this entire thread refer to the droid by name, and have not seen *a single person* refer to Donnie Yen's character by name, despite him being just about everyone's favorite along with the droid.\n- The acting for Rogue One in the main cast was for the most part solid, despite the dialogue being pretty shoddy often. But the minor and backdrop characters were often so poorly acted that they'd have so many moments that took you out of it the experience. And that hit me last night--TFA, down to its minor and backdrop characters, has really good writing and acting. Even the throwaway lines like the \"one quarter portion\" stuff, and the \"tell that to Kanjiklub\" lines are done well. Enough so that none of those lines take you out of the experience.

You didn't need to have the main antagonist beaten at the end of this film. You could have had the Rogue team get the message out at the cost of their lives, but we know ultimately they did defeat Tarkin due to the events of episode 4. It would be much more poetic than having Krennic who seemingly exists just so they had a bad to defeat. They didn't need to defeat anyone in this film, the entire point was that their lives were lost, but it won them the war. ",

It's not hard, because we can observe light from stars.  Edit: Or the obvious issues about being able to see planets from other solar systems being destroyed + the ex-post justifications about light from hyper-space matter traveling faster than light.)\n\nAnd the TFA characters are at least likeable (though with flawed character arcs).  And I will say TFA has the most interesting Star Wars villain in a long time.\n\nBut I was never excited to watch it again.  Actually I had tickets to a second showing after the first that I basically gave up.  I saw it once more on TV and enjoyed it even less.  I don't really have any desire to see it a third time, except in preparation for VIII.\n\nIn contrast, I am pumped to see a second screening of Rogue One this weekend. ",

I'm just saying the main characters in your movie have to have something going for them to get the attention of the audience and this movie had nothing. I'm not gonna be pissed if they die and I won't be able to see them being developed because I never cared for them in the first place. There are different examples of characters who are barely in a movie and yet audiences loved  and wanted more of despite the fact that they didn't really get any depth or development. ~~Hannibal Lecter un Silence of the Lambs or Jesus from The Big Lebowski come to mind. Maybe not the best examples but those are the ones I can think of right now. They had very small screentime and therefore very little development or exploration and yet people want more of them. I don't care what could have been of the Rogue One crew because they were one-dimensional and uninteresting. So kill them if you want to, it doesn't make a difference to me~~\n\nEDIT: I just thought of a better way to make my case. \n\n You say that the fact that these characters didn't get developed is what makes the scene work because we are robbed of what could have been and it gives more weight to their deaths. I say that only works if you can have some interest in the character to begin with so you'll be pissed if that development never comes in the end.\n\n Take Boba Fett. What do we know about him? He was a bounty hunter. That's it. No development, no depth, no characterization, nothing. And yet he must have had something going for him because fans still complain to this day about how he got killed off too soon and we never saw more of him. So that's an example that works like you say.\n\n Now take Mace Windu. What do we know about him? He was a Jedi Master. That's it. No development, no depth, no characterization, nothing. And when he died nobody gave a shit because there was no reason to. He had nothing to get the audiences to want to see more of him. I found the main characters in this movie to be the latter example.\n\n",

A Vader who didn't shoot him down just because he sensed the force in him and got distracted.\nTo defeat Kylo Ren, Rey closes her eyes, uses the force and beats him in a lightsaber duel.\n\nIn A New Hope, Luke constantly gets his ass kicked and has to work his ass off, and get the help of multiple people to get his final triumph, which makes it easy to cheer for him. Rey is a static character who kicks ass from minute 1 and just outperforms everyone because she's a special snowflake that doesn't need to work for anything or get anyone's help.\n\nShe'd fit perfectly alongside Milla Jovovich in a Resident Evil movie",

The filmmakers didn't blow their geek load and made something new with a new villain instead of fulfilling what I'm sure was their childhood dream when they played with Vader action figures. If this was the Vader show, people would complain they just rehashed stuff and didn't do anything new. Too much Vader would be bad and apparently too little Vader is bad too. But I really think they used him in just the right way. His first scene tied nicely with the prequels (the setting on Mustafar plus the fact that he was still in the healing process) and the second scene showed us what we always wanted to see. Why do more? Sure, it's always cool to see him, but on the other hand he's kind of sacred and what if they messed him up? \n\nAs for the Tarkin thing...I don't know if that needed any major explaining. The Empire is a military operation and a relatively young new Sith Lord can't be expected to lead a whole big operation, especially since he seems to spend most of his time on Mustafar doing weird Vader shit. In Ep. IV Tarkin is there to keep him in check, I think, and supervise him for the Emperor. ",

No, that was just put in there to make the fans applaud and cheer (which is exactly what happened). \n\nAnd trust me, I don't disagree with you about TFA.

Don't get me wrong, I love them, but it's definitely not in Vader's character. Especially the way it was accented--I feel like he must've been giggling to himself after he said that.\n\nRegarding other callbacks, they often just didn't feel necessary. Or just felt like they detracted. Another one I just remembered is Bail Organa showing up at the briefing to Jyn. Like, it makes sense for him to be there...but why did he have to suddenly come out of the shadows, have a musical cue devoted to him, Jyn stare him down, and then absolutely *zilch* come of it? \n\nIn TFA, the callbacks were either subtle, or were sources of sincere levity. Example of a subtle moment: Finn looking for medical supplies in the falcon, pulls out the training droid for like a second and wonders what it is, then tosses it and keeps looking. Almost zero attention spent to it, but a very clever easter egg that also made sense to be there. Example of a not-so-subtle moment that was hilarious: \"What about that ship?!\" \"That ship is garbage!\" *The pristine ship blows up* \"...the garbage ship will do.\" *Shows the Falcon*. Funny, clever, and harkens back to Luke's \"What a piece of junk!\" line in ANH.",

            "body": "\"Pointing fingers at other badly developed characters is not a good way to defend the writing in the film. Rey is not Superman, and even so, he felt more vulnerable in BvS than Rey ever did in TFA.\"\n\nWell, first, I wasn't just referring to Superman in BvS, which is an awful movie, I was referring to his overall character/development as an example. It's a fair point you make, but even some great characters had God Mode activated. Like Anakin Skywalker. He didnt even need a dad to be born, apparently. He also just all of a sudden threw away years of being evil because...?\nWriters get cheap all the time. I just think it's not fair you're pointing out every little example that applies to Rey, when it happens all the time. Most of what you're pointing out seems like overreactions, too.\n\n\"To defeat Kylo Ren, Rey closes her eyes, uses the force and beats him in a lightsaber duel.\"\n...Again, like I said, that was after being shot by Chewie's bad ass bowcaster, that was used throughout the movie in support of Rey and everyone else. Member when they were in the freighter as Han was being confronted by the bounty hunters? Rey almost got them all killed. She was saved by Finn as she was gawking at the monster things, then she subsequently saved him. They went back and forth throughout the film. Lets not forget: This was their first appearances. There is a lot of story/arc to go. \n\nRey had little-to-nothing to do with destroying the Starkiller base. That was the fleet, Han, Chewie, and Finn. She wasn't doing everything on her own. \n\n\"Luke tries to mess with the Falcon and Han tells him to shut up. Rey knows how to fly and fix the falcon better than Han Solo.\"\n\nShe's been around the Falcon for a large part of her life, it seemed ( although the extent wasnt detailed). They never allude to her being better than Solo, but she is very adept at repairs, flying, etc., like you said. This is also understandable that she'd be comparable or better than Solo because it's been years since he's seen or flown the thing. \n\nSo lets talk faults, though. She is stubborn as hell, and wants to return to Jaku, until she's convinced otherwise by Finn. She can't handle the Force at all when exposed to it. She runs off and is captured, putting Finn et. al at risk when they want to rescue her (granted, they'd want to go anyway in attempt to disable Starkiller). \n\nI mean really,we could sit here picking apart these nuances for days. We're not going to convince each other, it seems.",

Or if she knows that much backstory about the Falcon, why she thinks Luke Skywalker is a myth.  Also some of the \"callbacks\" are hard to distinguish from the rehashed material.\n\nRegarding Organa, I think the lighting and music were lost because they didn't delve into it.  But I think the main surprise would be for the characters.  Because this is an illegal rebellion, and here's an actual senator who is openly supporting us.  It'd be sort of like if Paul Ryan showed up to a terrorist meeting.  I think for many it was probably the first time they saw Organa or knew he was supporting them.  The timing also matches because they are talking about \"if we have the plans we can inform the senate\".  For characters in the rebellion I could see it being like \"Yeah right! How the fuck are we going to get the senate to listen to us even if we had the plans?\"  *boom Organa shows up*  (But I agree this sense was poorly communicated.)\n\nNot sure about Jyn staring him down.

I thought it was going to get to that when Jyn realizes she had been fooled into an assassination mission on her father. But when she returns to the rebel base she's all in for the rebellion. It didn't ring true to me at all. If they wanted me to accept that then there at least should have been a scene where she talks with Andor and understands the sacrifices that need to be made for the greater good.

You have a big fleet that docks in Crimea that you have to rent because you gave it away a couple decades ago. Now all of a sudden your stooge gets upended by his own people in yet another Western uprising in the country and it looks like they could pivot to the West and NATO. What do you do? Moron short sighted Vader would let Crimea go and do nothing in hopes of some future war with the West (ultimately ending in failure).
