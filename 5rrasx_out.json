The dude was a TRUE DICK for getting on that plane knowing he was going to die. The fact that it led to Big Bang boy finding a VCR at a swap meet was straight up crazy town. \n\n* These people are supposed to be 18 in this... \n\n* For real, who thought that the dialogue in the bedroom scene between the 'couple' was a good idea? Followed shortly by the \"I'll miss your smell\" and having the dude take his shirt off??? WTF?\n\n* Could this be the craziest/stupidest person ever in a horror movie? (the girlfriend) She texts/calls and gets no response, okay makes sense to worry. She gets a Skype from a girl IN HIS BEDROOM, so she drives up to try and stalk him and then DIGS THROUGH HIS PERSONAL PROPERTY. \n\n* The previous part also contains maybe the worst dialogue delivery since \"The Room\", along the lines of 'I just had the weirdest conversation of my life with a girl that called me' something like that, so bad.\n\n* Ok, I've stalked him to find out something isn't right. I've discovered that he is part of some strange killer VHS tape plot. WHAT DO I DO??? I watch the video tape and will sacrifice myself because I'm 18 and am in love with this cringe machine. \n\n* Umbrella opening jump scare\n\n* Fast forward to Vincent D'onofrio chewing scenery, while explaining 100% of the stuff you don't get because of bad movie making (Oh, he's blind? Oh, I totally wonder where they are taking THAT piece of business.)\n\n* Track back/maybe forward who knows. Cops dicking around with an empty car instead of HELPING A MAN UPSIDE DOWN IN A CAR DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM. The movie then turns to Final Destination for a second with some power poles.\n\n* Fast forward to \"Don't Breathe\" lite for about 10 minutes and SAMARA IS FREED SO YOU CAN BE FRIENDS NOW HOORAY! \n\n* Oh wait, your possessed now and they showed it all in the trailers and now Samara can magically imbue your Mac with RAM to be able to process thousands of simultaneous emails/uploads. Also those SICK instant email responses, cuz millennials get on those email chains quick right?\n\nI've seen every major horror release of the past 5 years, and in my opinion this was the worst one.

I was outright laughing at multiple points and so were other people. People would randomly come up to the main characters and introduce themselves while characters are doing illegal things with zero explanation.\n\nThe acting was terrible. Budget Zac Effron and Kristen Stewart were bad, and the fact that these obviously mid/upper 20's people were supposed to be college freshmen brought me out of the movie completely.\n\nThe writing in general was bad. *Spoilers*\n\nWhy did the people in the study not just send the video to their friends like at the end? How did 12 people get chosen enough to find the priest but somehow people havent started to put two and two together? How did missing sex dungeon not not draw any interest from police? How has no one heard about this professors sketchy ass research lab? When I did a psych study for the university there was so much oversight it boggles my mind no one thinks twice.\n\nReally the only redeeming quality was that I recognized locations on my college campus a ton.

            "body": "Typing this on my phone, while still in the theater building, just finished the film, so here are my immediate thoughts.\u00a0\n\n\nThe casting was terrible. While the boyfriend didn't distract me very much, neither did Gabriel, the Priest and Julia were horrid. The actress playing Julia suffered from the bad actress sy drone of feeling stoff, unable to express emotions other than a blank face, and (as used by another member here) felt like she was reading from queue cards.\u00a0\n\nI did like that they reused some of the original score, however, it didn't properly blend into the new one, which wasn't that great. I wished they would have also kept more of the blue filter as used in the original instead of the grimey green for this one.\u00a0\n\nThe 7 Club was a much better plot point for a sequel than the direction this one ultimately took. They introduced this whole idea of Samaras father, which ultimately falls apart during the third act by numerous plot holes. \n\nI actually found the tape within a tape thing interesting, and it was well executed. However, the idea that Samara was simply trying to be reborn into this world through someone's body is a little ambiguous (and was already done in Part 2). The Priest states that 11 other people got close to finding her body, but this begs the question as to why Julia was chosen versus anyone else watching the tape.\u00a0\n\nAlso, am I suppose to infer that Samaras bones being cremated was suppose to allow her to actively possess someone? She was pretty damn close to getting Aiden (I mean, she basically did). And before anyone says this disregards 2, it doesn't. Not only did they use the same name for the mother, they also showed the same photographs that Evelyn had stored in the suitcase in Part 2. It's clearly part of the time line.\u00a0\n\nHowever, the timeline is still all *beep* up. They never explain what happened to Evelyn, although the idea that she wanted to kill Samara remained, as in 2.\u00a0\n\nThe opening was far too rushed and not at all suspenseful. The original was great because it focuses more on suspense and the discovery aspect than it does jump scares. And while sure, Rachel had the nightmare, and the vision in the well towards the end, she was not plagued by cheap visions to help advance the plot. Literally, that was the entire decide used to advance the story. Instead of them really digging to find stuff, they would go \"Let's go to this town, where I will have a random vision while I'm awake so that I can tell the audience what happened back in the day, instead of using a well driven story and clues as in the original.\"\u00a0\n\nSkye (don't even get me started on her, I still don't understand why anyone casts her after Scream 4), states that things are getting worse, the visions more intense, and that Samara is getting pissed about the 7 club. Nice way to introduce something into the plot that never gets explored.\u00a0\n\nAlso slightly confused by the climax. Julia and the tape time frame becomes meaningless. Also, if Samara had the power to restore eyesight, then what was the purpose of having him be blind in the first place?\u00a0\n\nIt was established she can only kill you after 7 days once you watch the tape. Now she can appear whenever to kill you?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the film is watchable. While I don't hate 2 like everyone else (it is still no where near on par with the first), I would would say this falls slightly beneath that. This film could have excelled it they focused on the more interesting story of the Seven Club, and properly structured the father storyline without leaving gaping plot holes. Not to mention better tension, less cheap jump scares, and a cast who can act.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSay what you want about The Ring Two, but at least they casted solid actors.",

Unfortunately the main couple that were clearly late 20-somethings cast at college freshmen weren't quite as inspiring. \n\nI thought the movie felt more like a psychological mystery with a darker twist than an actual horror film. Meaning I was never really scared while watching the film, for a part of the movie even Samara could be considered on the good team which makes it hard to be scared in that scenario. The film felt more like a reboot than a sequel as well. There were a few plot points I found intriguing, mostly I liked the ending, some might call it cliche but I didn't see it coming and it had the right feeling of how a horror movie should end imo.\n\nOverall I would say the movie was decent. I don't think it lived up to the reputation the first movie has and by no means am I saying everyone should go out and see it but I certainly don't think it deserves the 1/10 and 2/10 reviews it seems to be getting. It was a serviceable film and wasn't any worse than most of the horror movies that have came out recently. I think a 6/10 or 7/10 is a fair score.\n\n",

            "body": "I know this wasn't a great movie, but I have a fantastic idea for a sequel. It would be called Rings: The Samara Cycle. \n\nThe film takes place ten years after the events of Rings. In the space of time between the two films, a lot has happened to reshape the world. The video went viral, causing thousands of people to perish. But on the plus side, humanity has figured out the mystery of the video and thus found a way to beat it. Building off of Professor Burke's \"tail\" experiment, we have figured out a way to perpetually exploit this system, creating a continuous loop of tails, or a cycle as it is called. To put it simply, Person A copies the file and shows Person B who copies the file and shows Person C who copies it and shows Person A. Thus creating a circle... a ring. \n\nIn this world, everyone knows about the tape mythos but it's a very taboo topic. It's gained a disturbing underground cult following. Weirdos will go to clubs (just like Club 7 in the Rings film) just to watch the tape and see how close they can get to the deadline without dying. Some people get off on it, like a fetish. Other people do it for the rush, like dumbass college kids. There are also people called Cyclers, who make it their job to find tails for a price. They work under the table and are hard to track down. \n\nThe conflict of the film arises when the whole world loses Internet and becomes crippled. Don't ask how. Just picture one giant server out in rural Idaho that has all the Internet on a big cloud, and it shuts down. The point is, the world no longer has Internet. Maybe it was a virus that Samara made. I'm going for a post-apocalyptic vibe. So now the world is in a state of panic. If you watched the tape and didn't pass it off, you're screwed. So the whole world is scrambling to find the long lost hard copies, which are incredibly valuable and circling around the black market. \n\nThe film follows a hacker named Grady (codename: Demagogue), who is trying to track down a hard copy, not for altruistic purposes, but simply to make a shameless profit. Somewhere along the way, he teams up with a 10-year-old girl named Beth, who is a jaded spunky orphan who reminds Grady a lot of himself. They go searching for this tape around the area where the servers crashed in Idaho. \n\nLong story short, it turns out that Beth is Julia and Holt's daughter from after the events of Rings took place. She is the new Samara (the \"rebirth\"). Julia and Holt died after giving birth to her (because she's evil) so Beth grows up as an orphan. \n\nI realize there's some plot holes I need to fill in, but you get basic idea. Oh, and also, it's very important that the film doesn't take itself too seriously. The tone should be similar to Hackers or some other shlocky sci-fi movie from the 1990s. Feel free to help me continue writing this masterpiece. We can start a Google Doc. ",

It's just a nice progression from the original that made sense and *would have* been really cool, had they not dropped the plotline without even explaining the experiment. \n\nMain theme was set up well and I'm glad they never really spelled this out like a lot of movies do. The story of Orpheus is an example of unconditional love. She was Orpheus in that she followed him into hell and watched the video, not out of curiosity or thrill seeking, but to save him. *Maybe* that's at least a decent explanation why she unlocked the bonus content? Whatever. From there they follow the plot of the original and by the middle it's clear that this is not a good movie. Point is, that love and empathy led to Samara taking revenge on who she wanted and spawning within Julia. \"We paid a high price for the charity we gave\" or something along those lines. \n\nOverall, some good ideas that got half-baked thrown together with some lazy writing. I thought the acting was at least on the upper end for horror and the effects were pretty good.",

Also really liked Vincent D'Onofrio's as well. The main actress wasn't really bad but I really hated her character very very much. The main actor was just generic to me that's about it. The overall plot was enjoyable. I really did like the twist that was the priest. The last scene of the movie was kind of predictable but I did really like it. Samara Morgan still does creep me out I'll admit that. The jump scares sucked. Overall the film isn't winning any awards any time soon. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone. If you do see yourself watching it. I think it's a big time waster movie. There are some good scenes in it and some bad scenes it. I think it's good enough for a one time watch. ",

Main character's boyfriend gets tangled up in it and she decides to voluntarily watch it to save him. \nProblems arise when it appears that the tape (now a .mov file after being copied as part of this society) has mutated into a new version of the tape that details the disappearance of a different girl. This new copy cannot be copied and basically forces Julia, the main girl, to solve the mystery to save herself.\n\nThis takes her to a town in the northwest where she finds out the girl on the tape was Samara's mother Evelyn who was captured an imprisoned in a secret church basement by a priest, raped and forced to have the child. Through the events of the first film, Samara dies in the well, but her corpse is later relocated to this town, where the body disappears from her grave. \n\nTurns out a blind man who oversees the graveyard is the priest and has Samara buried in his wall. The new mutation of the tape leads Julia to finding this body, liberating the corpse via cremation, breaking the curse.\n\nBut oh no, it is revealed right before the credits that Julia has been branded to become the vessel for Samara's rebirth.\n\nThis is a gross oversimplification of the plot, but basically hits the major points.",

She answers,It's some random broad (skye) she's like \"where is he?\" \n\"Bitch I don't know\" \n*face distorts \"he won't escape her\"\nShe goes to investigate at his college, bla bla bla comes across Gabreil. She follows him and sees there's a ring club or some shit where everyone watches the video and passes it to someone who volunteers so they don't die. \nShe follows skye back to her place and she's like \"watch this video\" \nJulia steals skyes phone for a bit to text Holt, he tells her not to watch. She hides in the bathroom and the ring girl kills skye. \nJulia and holt meet up again \nThey go to Gabriel's place and it turns out Julia watched an extended cut of the video after they escaped skyes house and she's already been marked, this goes on for a bit. Like the first two movies \"what is the mystery of the ring girl\" (I know her name is samera my phone just keeps correcting it so fuckit) \nSo they go to a church  cemetery to figure shit out all the while Julia is having visions like the movie 'take shelter' with the birds. But the kind priest says \" The ring girl is bured somewhere else not in this unmarked tomb with claw marks and writing on the inside\" \nMeanwhile Gabriel figures some shit out and leaves holt a voice message and drives to find him. But he gets in a car wreck, Julia and holt come across it and then an electrical pole falls and kills Gabriel while he's trying to convey important information. \nSo Julia goes back to the church and finds a cellar. The ring girls mom was apparently imprisoned here  by the priest until Samera was born. \nShe fights the priest. Uses the ring girl to kill the priest. Wins. Looks like she's finally resting in peace....\nUNTIL \nshe's showering, coughes up hair, holt finally receives Gabreils message, turns out the mark on Julia's hand is brail. \nMeanwhile Julia is still pulling hair from her mouth.

It is more difficult to frame and edit in a well placed jumpscare than to film a dark forest while atmospheric nature sounds or lynchian noise plays. \n\n\n\"oh jumpscares are too simple, anyone jumps from being startled!\" and the same can be said for the myriad of \"prestige\" horror movies that use the exact same atmospheric techniques that would make anyone uncomfortable. I'm not saying all jumpscares are good, or that movies never overuse them, but I disagree with the common idea that jumpscares are automatically bad because they aren't a slow burn. The main point I am making is that generalizing film techniques as absolutely bad or good makes no sense, sometimes there are good jumpscares sometimes there aren't. It's like saying jokes are bad because you've watched Adam Sandler's movies, or that jokes in general are just a cheap way to get a reaction from the audience. ",

She may have struggled with the intentions behind some of her lines because of this. \nI agree on the score. I liked that Matthew Margeson used the original Ring themes at points (I felt it was especially effective during the climax) but the new material felt a bit bland and flat. \nI think (though I'm only guessing) that the people that are chosen are the ones that watch the tape of their own free will knowing that it will kill them? Either that or Samara has a vetting process and when you start watching if she thinks you're a good host for rebirth, she shows you the extra images. \nThis was a little different in regards to the possession aspect. I think that Samara became Julia (as in there was no Julia left, whereas with Aidan he was still there, but Samara had the wheel). \nI agree about the opening. I never got the sense of dread from this film that I got with the Ring. In regards to tension and release, instead of going from a zig to a zag, it went from one setup to another, with no real release that would leave you feeling uneasy. \nThe priest didn't know Samara could cure blindness, so I guess he figured that by blinding himself he was safe from her. \nI assumed that this was Julia's day 7 (based on the fact that in this film, before Samara comes to kill you, you get a nosebleed [Skye and the plane guy both had this happen] and Julia got one right before she found the bones. This brings me to another gripe though in that I wish this film used the time cards like the first so you knew exactly where you were. Technically we have no idea how much time passes after Julia watches the tape and can only make inferences about it. \n",

However when The Ring Two failed critically they didn't want to risk a third film and it was shelved. When talks started up again about a third film everyone assumed they were going with the prequel idea until the director stated that it was a sequel.",

No narrative spoilers, just some touching on some surface analysis of genre conventions. \n\nRing is my favorite of the three, and I genuinely feel that it's a standout in the horror genre. It works fantastically as a standalone, and leaves the story in a good spot. Specifically, I think it works well because it's a genre piece. It doesn't go too far outside the box, but works cleverly within the confines of horror, and does great work with existing horror tropes. I don't have to sing too many praises here, if you've already read it, though I could go on and on about how much I love this book. \n\nSpiral is in some ways an equally good read, but also gets into weird territory when you compare it to Ring. In a lot of ways, it's something more of meta-fiction than a work of horror. It starts playing with a sci-fi horror blend, and goes in some pretty unexpected directions. To that end, it's an equally great read in some ways, but also can come across as compromising what made the first book fantastic. Spiral essentially takes the idea of the Ring narrative, and questions its validity as a narrative, both in universe and out of universe from the reader's perspective. If you're going to read Spiral, I would argue that you *have* to read Loop. \n\nLoop does something really interesting, in that where Spiral questions Ring, Loop questions everything you know about the narrative so far. It takes the entire story in a different direction, and treads way more into sci-fi. In a lot of ways I would even argue that it's essentially a sci-fi reading of the horror genre. It pokes holes in horror conventions, only to fill those holes with sci-fi tropes. It's a fantastic read from a literary perspective, in that I have to appreciate what it does for the trilogy overall, but depending on what you're looking for also suffers in the same way that Spiral suffers - it shatters the horror narrative, and leaves Ring as a very different text. This leads to some excellent moments, but also to some frustration, if you truly love what gets set up in the first book. \n\nTL;DR - I recommend all three, but if you're going to read Spiral, you pretty much have to read Loop in order to get a full appreciation for what's happening to the books as a whole.

Once someone does something different it will be lauded and the director may go on and rule Hollywood. Gore Verbinski (The Ring to Pirates of the Caribbean), Peter Jackson (Brain Dead to Lord of the Rings), Sam Rami (Evil Dead to Spiderman, Steven Spielberg (Duel, Jaws to everything), Francis Ford Coppola, Roman Polanski, James Cameron, etc., etc.\n\nBut then anytime you do get a truly great movie, it is inevitably followed by a bunch of imitators. Blair Witch led to a bunch of found footage movies, The Ring led to a bunch of J Horror remakes, Evil Dead lead to a bunch of splatter movies, Hostel led to a bunch of torture porn. Halloween led to a bunch of slasher movies and then Scream reignited that genre. About a decade after Scream it lead to a bunch of horror movies that deconstruct horror movies (Final Girls, House of the Devil, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, Scream Queens, Buffy).\n\nSaying that horror uses just a bunch of lazy jump scares is a lazy way to describe horror. Horror movies are simultaneously going to have the dregs and most creative films out there because they are relatively cheap with high profit margins. It is a genre that a lot of great and terrible directors will cut their teeth on.",
